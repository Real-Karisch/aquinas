  <h2>31. The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
<br>32. Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
<br>33. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
<br>34. But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
<br>35. And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.
<br>36. For these things were done, that the Scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
<br>37. And again another Scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.

  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxxxv) The Jews who strained at a gnat and swallowed a camel, after their audacious wickedness, reason scrupulously about the day: The Jews therefore because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath.

  BEDE. Parasceue, i. e. preparation: the sixth day was so called because the children of Israel prepared twice the number of loaves on that day. For that sabbath day was an high day, i. e. on account of the feast of the passover.
