  <h2>6. When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
<br>7. Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judæa again.
<br>8. His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
<br>9. Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
<br>10. But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.

  ALCUIN. Our Lord heard of the sickness of Lazarus, but suffered four days to pass before He cured it; that the recovery might be a more wonderful one. When He had heard therefore that he was sick, He abode two days still in the place where He was.

  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxii. 1) To give time for his death and burial, that they might say, he stinketh, and none doubt that it was death, and not a trance, from which he was raised.
