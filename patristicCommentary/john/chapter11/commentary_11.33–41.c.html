  <h2>Jesus wept.
</h2>
  ALCUIN. Because He was the fountain of pity. He wept in His human nature for him whom He was able to raise again by His divine.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlix. non occ.) Wherefore did Christ weep, but to teach men to weep?

  <br />
  <br />
  BEDE. It is customary to mourn over the death of friends; and thus the Jews explained our Lord’s weeping: Then said the Jews, Behold how He loved him.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlix. 21) Loved him. Our Lord came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. And some of them said, Could not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? He was about to do more than this, to raise him from death.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxiii. 1) It was His enemies who said this. The very works, which should have evidenced His power, they turn against Him, as if He had not really done them. This is the way that they speak of the miracle of opening the eyes of the man that was born blind. They even prejudge Christ before He has come to the grave, and have not the patience to wait for the issue of the matter. Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself, cometh to the grave. That He wept, and He groaned, are mentioned to shew us the reality of His human nature. John who enters into higher statements as to His nature than any of the other Evangelists, also descends lower than any in describing His bodily affections.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlix) And do thou too groan in thyself, if thou wouldest rise to new life. To every man is this said, who is weighed down by any vicious habit. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. The dead under the stone is the guilty under the Law. For the Law, which was given to the Jews, was graven on stone. And all the guilty are under the Law, for the Law was not made for a righteous man.

  <br />
  <br />
  BEDE. A cave is a hollow in a rock. It is called a monument, because it reminds us of the dead.
