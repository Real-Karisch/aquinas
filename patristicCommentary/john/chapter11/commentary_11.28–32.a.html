  <h2>28. And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.
<br>29. And as soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.
<br>30. Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.
<br>31. The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.
<br>32. Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
</h2>
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxii. 3) Christ’s words had the effect of stopping Martha’s grief. In her devotion to her Master she had no time to think of her afflictions: And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlix. 16) Silently1, i. e. speaking in a low voice. For she did speak, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxii) She calls her sister secretly, in order not to let the Jews know that Christ was coming. (non occ.). For had they known, they would have gone, and not been witnesses of the miracle.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlix. 16) We may observe that the Evangelist has not said, where, or when, or how, the Lord called Mary, but for brevity’s sake has left it to be gathered from Martha’s words.

  <br />
  <br />
  THEOPHYLACT. Perhaps she thought the presence of Christ in itself a call, as if it were inexcusable, when Christ came, that she should not go out to meet Him.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxiii. 1) While the rest sat around her in her sorrow, she did not wait for the Master to come to her, but, not letting her grief detain her, rose immediately to meet Him; As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto Him.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlix. non occ.) So we see, if she had known of His arrival before, she would not have let Martha go without her.
