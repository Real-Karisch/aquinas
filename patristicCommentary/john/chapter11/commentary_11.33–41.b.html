  <h2>They said unto Him, Lord, come and see.
</h2>
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxiii. 1) He had not yet raised any one from the dead; and seemed as if He came to weep, not to raise to life. Wherefore they say to Him, Come and see.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlix. 20.) The Lord sees when He pities, as we read, Look upon my adversity and misery, and forgive me all my sin. (Ps. 24:18.)
