  <h2>Jesus said, Take ye away the stone.
</h2>
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxiii. 2) But why did He not raise him without taking away the stone? Could not He who moved a dead body by His voice, much more have moved a stone? He purposely did not do so, in order that the miracle might take place in the sight of all; to give no room for saying, as they had said in the case of the blind man, This is not he. Now they might go into the grave, and feel and see that this was the man.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlix. c. 22) Take ye away the stone; mystically, Take away the burden of the law, proclaim grace.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (lib. 83. Quæst. qu. 61) Perhaps those are signified who wished to impose the rite of circumcision on the Gentile converts; or men in the Church of corrupt life, who offend believers.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (de Ver. Dom. serm. lii) Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, though they had often seen Christ raise the dead, did not fully believe that He could raise their brother; Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto Him, Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he hath been dead four days.

  <br />
  <br />
  THEOPHYLACT. Martha said this from weakness of faith, thinking it impossible that Christ could raise her brother, so long after death.

  <br />
  <br />
  BEDE. (non occ. [Nic.]) Or, these are not words of despair, but of wonder.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxiii. 2) Thus every thing tends to stop the months of the unbelieving. Their hands take away the stone, their ears hear Christ’s voice, their eyes see Lazarus come forth, they perceive the smell of the dead body.

  <br />
  <br />
  THEOPHYLACT. Christ reminds Martha of what He had told her before, which she had forgotten: Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxiii) She did not remember what He said above, He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. To the disciples He had said, That the Son of God might be glorified thereby; here it is the glory of the Father He speaks of. The difference is made to suit the different hearers. Our Lord could not rebuke her before such a number, but only says, Thou shalt see the glory of God.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlix) Herein is the glory of God, that he that stinketh and hath been dead four days, is brought to life again.
