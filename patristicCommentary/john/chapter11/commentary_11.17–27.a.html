  <h2>17. Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.
<br>18. Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
<br>19. And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
<br>20. Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.
<br>21. Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
<br>22. But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.
<br>23. Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
<br>24. Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
<br>25. Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
<br>26. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
<br>27. She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
</h2>
  ALCUIN. Our Lord delayed His coming for four days, that the resurrection of Lazarus might be the more glorious: Then when Jesus came, He found that He had lain in the grave four days already.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxii. 2) Our Lord had stayed two days, and the messenger had come the day before; the very day on which Lazarus died. This brings us to the fourth day.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tract. xlix. 12) Of the four days many things may be said. They refer to one thing, but one thing viewed in different ways. There is one day of death which the law of our birth brings upon us. Men transgress the natural law, and this is another day of death. The written law is given to men by the hands of Moses, and that is despised—a third day of death. The Gospel comes, and men transgress it—a fourth day of death. But Christ doth not disdain to awaken even these.

  <br />
  <br />
  ALCUIN. The first sin was elation of heart, the second assent, the third act, the fourth habit.
