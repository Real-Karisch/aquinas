  <h2>For he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.
</h2>
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxviii. 1) What things do the Jews now, and know not what they do; thinking, like men in the dark, that they are going the right road, while they are taking directly the wrong one. Wherefore He adds, While ye have the light, believe in the light.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. lii) i. e. While ye have any truth, believe in the truth, that ye may be born again of the truth: That ye may be the children of the light.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxviii) i. e. My children. In the beginning of the Gospel it is said, Born of God, (c. 1:13) i. e. of the Father. But here He Himself is the Begetter. The same act is the act both of Father and Son.
