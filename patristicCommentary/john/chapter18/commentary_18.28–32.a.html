  <h2>28. Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the Passover.
<br>29. Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?
<br>30. They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.
<br>31. Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.
<br>32. That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.

  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. cxiv) The Evangelist returns to the part where he had left off, in order to relate Peter’s denial: Then led they Jesus to Caiaphas (a Caiapha Vulg.) unto the hall of judgment: to Caiaphas from his colleague and father in law Annas, as has been said. But if to Caiaphas, how to the prætorium, which was the place where the governor Pilate resided?

  <br />
  <br />
  BEDE. The prætorium is the place where the prætor sat. Prætors were called prefects and preceptors, because they issue decrees.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. cxiv) Either then for some urgent reason Caiaphas proceeded from the house of Annas, where both had been sitting, to the prætorium of the governor, and left Jesus to the hearing of his father in law: or Pilate had established the prætorium in the house of Caiaphas, which was large enough to afford a separate lodging to its owner, and the governor at the same time.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (de Con. Evang. l. iii. c. vii) According to Matthew, When the morning came, they led Him away, and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate. (Mat. 27:1, 2) But He was to have been led to Caiaphas at first. How is it then that He was brought to him so late? The truth is, now He was going as it were a committed criminal, Caiaphas having already determined on His death. And He was to be given up to Pilate immediately.
