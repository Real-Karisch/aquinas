  <h2>40. Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
<br>41. Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
<br>42. Hath not the Scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
<br>43. So there was a division among the people because of him.
<br>44. And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
<br>45. Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
<br>46. The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
<br>47. Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
<br>48. Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
<br>49. But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
<br>50. Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
<br>51. Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
<br>52. They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
<br>53. And every man went unto his own house.

  AUGUSTINE. (Tract. xxxiii. 1) Our Lord having invited those, who believed in Him, to drink of the Holy Spirit, a dissension arose among the multitude: Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.

  <br />
  <br />
  THEOPHYLACT. The one, that is, who was expected. Others, i. e. the people said, This is the Christ.

  ALCUIN. These had now begun to drink in that spiritual thirst1, and had laid aside the unbelieving thirst. But others still remained dried up in their unbelief: But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? Hath not the Scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? They knew what were the predictions of the Prophets respecting Christ, but knew not that they all were fulfilled in Him. They knew that He had been brought up at Nazareth, but the place of His birth they did not know; and did not believe that it answered to the prophecies.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. li. 2.) But be it so, they knew not His birth-place: were they ignorant also of His extraction? that He was of the house and family of David? Why did they ask, Hath not the Scripture said, that Christ cometh of the seed of David? They wished to conceal His extraction, and therefore put forward where He had been educated. For this reason, they do not go to Christ and ask, How say the Scriptures that Christ must come from Bethlehem, whereas Thou comest from Galilee? purposely and of malice prepense they do not do this. And because they were thus inattentive, and indifferent about knowing the truth, Christ did not answer them: though He had lauded Nathanael, when he said, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? and called Him an Israelite indeed, as being a lover of truth, and well learned in the ancient Scriptures.
