<a href="commentary_7.1–8.a.html">1. After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
<br>2. Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.
<br>3. His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
<br>4. For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.
<br>5. For neither did his brethren believe in him.
<br>6. Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
<br>7. The world cannot hate you: but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
<br>8. Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet fully come.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_7.1–8.b.html">I go not up unto this feast;
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_7.9–13.html">9. When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
<br>10. But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
<br>11. Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
<br>12. And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
<br>13. Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_7.14–18.html">14. Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
<br>15. And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
<br>16. Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
<br>17. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
<br>18. He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_7.19–24.html">19. did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?
<br>20. The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
<br>21. Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
<br>22. Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision: (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers:) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
<br>23. If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
<br>24. Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_7.25–30.html">25. Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
<br>26. But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
<br>27. Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
<br>28. Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
<br>29. But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
<br>30. Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_7.31–36.html">31. And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?
<br>32. The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
<br>33. Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.
<br>34. Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.
<br>35. Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
<br>36. What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_7.37–39.html">37. In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
<br>38. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
<br>39. (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_7.40–53.a.html">40. Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
<br>41. Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
<br>42. Hath not the Scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
<br>43. So there was a division among the people because of him.
<br>44. And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
<br>45. Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
<br>46. The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
<br>47. Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
<br>48. Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
<br>49. But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
<br>50. Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
<br>51. Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
<br>52. They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
<br>53. And every man went unto his own house.
