<a href="commentary_2.1–4.a.html">1. And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
<br>2. And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
<br>3. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
<br>4. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.

<a href="commentary_2.5–11.a.html">5. His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
<br>6. And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
<br>7. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
<br>8. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.
<br>9. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
<br>10. And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
<br>11. This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.

<a href="commentary_2.12–13.html">12. After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
<br>13. And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_2.14–17.html">14. And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
<br>15. And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;
<br>16. And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.
<br>17. And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_2.18–22.html">18. Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
<br>19. Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
<br>20. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
<br>21. But he spake of the temple of his body.
<br>22. When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them: and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_2.23–25.html">23. Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
<br>24. But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men.
<br>25. And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
