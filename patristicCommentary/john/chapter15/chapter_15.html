<a href="commentary_15.1–3.html">1. I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
<br>2. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
<br>3. Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_15.4–7.html">4. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
<br>5. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
<br>6. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
<br>7. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_15.8–11.html">8. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.
<br>9. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.
<br>10. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love: even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.
<br>11. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_15.12–16.a.html">12. This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.
<br>13. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
<br>14. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
<br>15. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
<br>16. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_15.12–16.b.html">But I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of My Father, I have made known unto you.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_15.17–21.html">17. These things I command you, that ye love one another.
<br>18. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.
<br>19. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
<br>20. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
<br>21. But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_15.22–25.html">22. If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.
<br>23. He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
<br>24. If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
<br>25. But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_15.26–27.html">26. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:
<br>27. And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
