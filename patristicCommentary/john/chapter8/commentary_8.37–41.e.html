  <h2>Ye do the works of your father.
</h2>
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlii. 6) He does not say as yet who is their father.

  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. liv. 2) Our Lord says this with a view to put down their vain boasting of their descent; and persuade them to vest their hopes of salvation no longer on the natural relationship, but on the adoption. For this it was which prevented them from coming to Christ; viz. their thinking that their relationship to Abraham was sufficient for their salvation.
