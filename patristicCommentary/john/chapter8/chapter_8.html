<a href="commentary_8.1–11.a.html">1. Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
<br>2. And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
<br>3. And the Scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
<br>4. They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
<br>5. Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?
<br>6. This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.
<br>7. So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
<br>8. And again He stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
<br>9. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
<br>10. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
<br>11. She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

<a href="commentary_8.1–11.b.html">So when they continued asking Him, He lifted Himself up.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.12.html">12. Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.13–18.html">13. The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.
<br>14. Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.
<br>15. Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
<br>16. And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
<br>17. It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.
<br>18. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.19–20.a.html">19. Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.
<br>20. These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.19–20.b.html">These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as He taught in the temple.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.21–24.html">21. Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.
<br>22. Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.
<br>23. And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world, I am not of this world.
<br>24. I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.25–27.html">25. Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.
<br>26. I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.
<br>27. They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.28–30.html">28. Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
<br>29. And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
<br>30. As he spake these words, many believed on him.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.31–36.a.html">31. Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;
<br>32. And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
<br>33. They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
<br>34. Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.
<br>35. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.
<br>36. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.31–36.b.html">And ye shall know the truth.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.37–41.a.html">37. I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.
<br>38. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
<br>39. They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
<br>40. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.
<br>41. Ye do the deeds of your father.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.37–41.b.html">And ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.37–41.c.html">But now ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.37–41.d.html">This did not Abraham.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.37–41.e.html">Ye do the works of your father.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.41–43.html">41. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.
<br>42. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.
<br>43. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.44–47.a.html">44. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
<br>45. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.
<br>46. Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?
<br>47. He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.44–47.b.html">When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.48–51.html">48. Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
<br>49. Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.
<br>50. And I seek not mine own glory; there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
<br>51. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.52–56.html">52. Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.
<br>53. Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead; whom makest thou thyself?
<br>54. Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing; it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:
<br>55. Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.
<br>56. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.
</a>
<br />
<a href="commentary_8.57–59.html">57. Then said the Jews unto him. Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
<br>58. Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.
<br>59. Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
