  <h2>And leadeth them out.
</h2>
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lix. 2) He led out the sheep, when He sent them not out of the reach of, but into the midst of, the wolves. There seems to be a secret allusion to the blind man. He called him out of the midst of the Jews; and he heard His voice.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlv. 14) And who is He who leads them out, but the Same who loosens the chain of their sins, that they may follow Him with free unfettered step?

  <br />
  <br />
  GLOSS. And when He putteth forth His own sheep, He goeth before them, He leadeth them out from the darkness of ignorance into light, while He goeth before in the pillar of cloud, and fire.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lix. 2) Shepherds always go behind their sheep; but He, on the contrary, goes before, to shew that He would lead all to the truth.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlv. c. 14) And who is this that goeth before the sheep, but He who being raised from the dead, dieth no more; (Rom. 6:9) and who said, Father, I will also that they, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am? (Infra 17:24)
