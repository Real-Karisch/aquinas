  <h2>To Him the porter openeth.
</h2>
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. xlix. 2) The porter perhaps is Moses; for to him the oracles of God were committed.

  <br />
  <br />
  THEOPHYLACT. Or, the Holy Spirit is the porter, by whom the Scriptures are unlocked, and reveal the truth to us.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlvi. 2) Or, the porter is our Lord Himself; for there is much less difference between a door and a porter, than between a door and a shepherd. And He has called Himself both the door and the shepherd. Why then not the door and the porter? He opens Himself, i. e. reveals1 Himself. If thou seek another person for porter, take the Holy Spirit, of whom our Lord below saith, He will guide you into all truth. (c. 16:13) The door is Christ, the Truth; who openeth the door, but He that will guide you into all Truth? Whomsoever thou understand here, beware that thou esteem not the porter greater than the door; for in our houses the porter ranks above the door, not the door above the porter.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lix. 3. c. 7, 48.) As they had called Him a deceiver, and appealed to their own unbelief as the proof of it; (Which of the rulers believeth on Him?) He shews here that it was because they refused to hear Him, that they were put out of His flock. The sheep hear His voice. The Shepherd enters by the lawful door; and they who follow Him are His sheep; they who do not, voluntarily put themselves out of His flock.
