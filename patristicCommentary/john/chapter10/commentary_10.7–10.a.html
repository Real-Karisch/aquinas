  <h2>7. Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
<br>8. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
<br>9. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
<br>10. The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.
</h2>
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lix. 3) Our Lord, to waken the attention of the Jews, unfolds the meaning of what He has said; Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.

  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xlv. 8) Lo, the very door which He had shut up, He openeth; He is the Door: let us enter, and let us enter with joy.
