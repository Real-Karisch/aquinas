  <h2>24. Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
<br>25. He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
<br>26. Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
<br>27. He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?
<br>28. Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.
<br>29. We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.
<br>30. The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.
<br>31. Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
<br>32. Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
<br>33. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
<br>34. They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lviii. 2) The parents having referred the Pharisees to the healed man himself, they summon him a second time: Then again called they the man that was blind. They do not openly say now, Deny that Christ has healed thee, but conceal their object under the pretence of religion: Give God the praise, i. e. confess that this man has had nothing to do with the work.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xliv. s. 11) Deny that thou hast received the benefit. This is not to give God the glory, but rather to blaspheme Him.

  <br />
  <br />
  ALCUIN. They wished him to give glory to God, by calling Christ a sinner, as they did: We know that this man is a sinner.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lviii. 2) Why then did ye not convict Him, when He said above, Which of you convinceth Me of sin? (c. 8:46)

  <br />
  <br />
  ALCUIN. The man, that he might neither expose himself to calumny, nor at the same time conceal the truth, answers not that he knew Him to be righteous, but, Whether He be a sinner or no, I know not.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lviii. 2) But how comes this, whether He be a sinner, I know not, from one who had said, He is a Prophet? did the blind fear? far from it: he only thought that our Lord’s defence lay in the witness of the fact, more than in another’s pleading. And he gives weight to his reply by the mention of the benefit he had received: One thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see: as if to say, I say nothing as to whether He is a sinner; but only repeat what I know for certain. So being unable to overturn the fact itself of the miracle, they fall back upon former arguments, and enquire the manner of the cure: just as dogs in hunting pursue wherever the scent takes them: Then said they to him again, What did He do to thee? How opened He thine eyes? i. e. was it by any charm? For they do not say, How didst thou see? but, How opened He thine eyes? to give the man an opportunity of detracting from the operation. So long now as the matter wanted examining, the blind man answers gently and quietly; but, the victory being gained, he grows bolder: He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? i. e. Ye do not attend to what is said, and therefore I will no longer answer you vain questions, put for the sake of cavil, not to gain knowledge: Will ye also be His disciples?

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xliv. s. 11) Will ye also? i. e. I am already, do ye wish to be? I see now, but do not envy (video, non invideo). He says this in indignation at the obstinacy of the Jews; not tolerating blindness, now that he is no longer blind himself.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lviii. 2) As then truth is strength, so falsehood is weakness: truth elevates and ennobles whomever it takes up, however mean before: falsehood brings even the strong to weakness and contempt.
