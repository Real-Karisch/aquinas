  <h2>And the Word was with God.
</h2>
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. iii. [ii.] 3) Because it is an especial attribute of God, to be eternal and without a beginning, he laid this down first: then, lest any one on hearing in the beginning was the Word, should suppose the Word Unbegotten, he instantly guarded against this; saying, And the Word was with God.

  <br />
  <br />
  HILARY. (ii. de Trin) From the beginning He is with God: and though independent of time, is not independent of an Author.

  <br />
  <br />
  BASIL. (Hom. in princ. Joan. ยง. 4) Again he repeats this, was, because of men blasphemously saying, that there was a time when He was not. Where then was the Word? Illimitable things are not contained in space. Where was He then? With God. For neither is the Father bounded by place, nor the Son by aught circumscribing.

  <br />
  <br />
  ORIGEN. (Hom. ii. in Joan. c. 1) It is worth while noting, that, whereas the Word is said to come1 [be made] to some, as to Hosea, Isaiah, Jeremiah, with God it is not made, as though it were not with Him before. But, the Word having been always with Him, it is said, and the Word was with God: for from the beginning it was not separate from the Father.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. iii) He has not said, was in God, but was with God: exhibiting to us that eternity which He had in accordance with His Person.

  <br />
  <br />
  THEOPHYLACT. (in loco.) Sabellius is overthrown by this text. For he asserts that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are one Person, Who sometimes appeared as the Father, sometimes as the Son, sometimes as the Holy Ghost. But he is manifestly confounded by this text, and the Word was with God; for here the Evangelist declares that the Son is one Person, God the Father another.
