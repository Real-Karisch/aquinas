  <h2>1. After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<br>2. Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
<br>3. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
<br>4. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in, was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
<br>5. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
<br>6. When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
<br>7. The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
<br>8. Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
<br>9. And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
<br>10. The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
<br>11. He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
<br>12. Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
<br>13. And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.

  AUGUSTINE. (de Con. Evang. l. iv. c. 10) After the miracle in Galilee, He returns to Jerusalem: After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. xxxvi. 1) The feast of Pentecost. Jesus always went up to Jerusalem at the time of the feasts, that it might be seen that He was not an enemy to, but an observer of, the Law. And it gave Him the opportunity of impressing the simple multitude by miracles and teaching: as great numbers used then to collect from the neighbouring towns.
