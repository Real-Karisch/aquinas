  <h2>22. After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judæa; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
<br>23. And John also was baptizing in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
<br>24. For John was not yet cast into prison.
<br>25. Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.
<br>26. And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.

  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. xxix. 1) Nothing is more open than truth, nothing bolder; it neither seeks concealment, or avoids danger, or fears the snare, or cares for popularity. It is subject to no human weakness. Our Lord went up to Jerusalem at the feasts, not from ostentation or love of honour, but to teach the people His doctrines, and shew miracles of mercy. After the festival He visited the crowds who were collected at the Jordan. After these things came Jesus and His disciples into the land of Judæa; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.

  <br />
  <br />
  BEDE. After these things, is not immediately after His dispute with Nicodemus, which took place at Jerusalem; but on His return to Jerusalem after some time spent in Galilee.

  <br />
  <br />
  ALCUIN. By Judæa are meant those who confess, whom Christ visits; for wherever there is confession of sins, or the praise of God, thither cometh Christ and His disciples, i. e. His doctrine and enlightenment; and there He is known by His cleansing men from sin: And there He tarried with them, and baptized.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. xxix. 1) As the Evangelist says afterwards, that Jesus baptized not but His disciples, it is evident that he means the same here, i. e. that the disciples only baptized.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. xiii. c. 4) Our Lord did not baptize with the baptism wherewith He had been baptized; for He was baptized by a servant, as a lesson of humility to us, and in order to bring us to the Lord’s baptism, i. e. His own; for Jesus baptized, as the Lord, the Son of God.

  <br />
  <br />
  BEDE. John still continues baptizing, though Christ has begun; for the shadow remains still, nor must the forerunner cease, till the truth is manifested. And John also was baptizing in Ænon, near to Salim. Ænon is Hebrew for water; so that the Evangelist gives, as it were, the derivation of the name, when he adds, For there was much water there. Salim is a town on the Jordan, where Melchisedec once reigned.

  <br />
  <br />
  JEROME. (Hierom. Ep. c. xxiii. ad Evag.) It matters not whether it is called Salem, or Salim; since the Jews very rarely use vowels in the middle of words; and the same words are pronounced with different vowels and accents, by different readers, and in different places.
