  <h2>6. Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter said unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
<br>7. Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
<br>8. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
<br>9. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
<br>10. Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.
<br>11. For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
</h2>
  ORIGEN. (t. xxxii.) As a physician, who has many sick under his care, begins with those who want his attention most; so Christ, in washing His disciples’ feet, begins with the most unclean, and so comes at last to Peter, who needed the washing less than any: Then cometh He to Simon Peter. Peter resisted being washed, perhaps because his feet were nearly clean: And Peter said unto Him, Lord, dost Thou wash my feel?

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. (Tr. lvi. 1) What is the meaning of Thou and my feet? It is better to think than speak of this; lest one should fail in explaining adequately what might have been rightly conceived.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxx. 2) Though Peter was the first of the Apostles, yet it is possible that the traitor petulantly placed himself above him; and that this may be the reason, why our Lord first began to wash, and then cometh to Peter.

  <br />
  <br />
  THEOPHYLACT. It is plain that our Lord did not wash Peter first, but none other of the disciples would have attempted to be washed before him.

  <br />
  <br />
  CHRYSOSTOM. (Hom. lxx. 2) Some one will ask why none of them prevented Him, except Peter, this being a sign not of want of love, but of reverence. The reason seems to be, that He washed the traitor first, and came next to Peter, and that the other disciples were checked by the reply to Peter. Any of the rest would have said what Peter did, had his turn come first.

  <br />
  <br />
  ORIGEN. (t. xxxii. 5.) Or thus: All the rest put out their feet, certain that so great a one would not want to wash them without reason: but Peter, looking only to the thing itself, and seeing nothing beyond it, refused out of reverence to let his feet be washed. He often appears in Scripture as hasty in putting forth his own ideas of what is right and expedient.

  <br />
  <br />
  AUGUSTINE. Or thus: We must not suppose that Peter was afraid and refused, when the others had willingly and gladly submitted to the washing. Our Lord did not go through the others first, and to the first of the Apostles afterwards; (for who is ignorant that the most blessed Peter was the first of all the Apostles?) but began with him: and Peter being the first to whom He came, was afraid; as indeed any of the others would have been.
