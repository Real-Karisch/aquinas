In regard to the first it should be noted that the word \u2018predestination\u2019 is taken from \u2018destination\u2019; for something is said to be predestined as though destined beforehand. But destination is taken in two senses: in one sense, to destine is to send, for those who are sent to achieve some purpose are said to be destined, in accord with 1 Maccabees: <i>some of the people were destined, and they went to the king</i> (1 Macc 1:14). In another sense, to destine is to determine, as in 2 Maccabees: <i>Eleazar destined not to do any unlawful things</i> (2 Macc 6:20). But this second meaning seems to be derived from the first. For as a courier who is sent is directed to something, so whatever we determine we direct to some end. According to this, therefore, to predestine is nothing more than to determine beforehand in the heart what is to be done in regard to some thing."

And this on account of the danger involved in frequent swearing, namely, the possibility of perjury due to a slip of the tongue. Ecclesiastes says, <i>do not accustom your mouth to oaths for many are tripped by them</i> (Sir 23:9). Also because it seems contrary to the reverence we owe God for one to call God as witness without necessity. Hence: <i>let not the naming of God be usual in your mouth</i> (Sir 23:10).

One of these features is something preceding the sin, as the withdrawal of grace, from which it follows that a man sins. Another is something that accompanies the sin either interiorly, as that the mind is disarranged; hence Augustine says in <i>Confessions</i> I: <i>you have commanded it, O Lord</i>, and so it comes to pass that every disarranged mind is a punishment to itself; or in regard to its outward acts, which involve difficulties and labors, as sinners aver: <i>we journeyed through trackless deserts</i> (Wis 5:7).

But if someone desires to usurp judgment over matters not divinely granted him to judge, the judgment is rash, just as if a judge delegated by the Pope wished to go beyond the limits of his mandate. But God has reserved to himself the judging of hidden things, which are mainly the thoughts of the heart and the future. Therefore, if anyone presumed to judge about these matters, the judgment would be rash. Hence Augustine says in <i>The Lord\u2019s Sermon on the Mount</i>: <i>a judgment is rash in these two cases, since there is uncertainty about the intention with which something was done, or uncertainty about the future of one who now seems to be good or evil</i>."

Therefore, when an unbeliever does something good from the dictate of reason and does not refer it to an evil end, he does not sin. However, his deed is not meritorious, because it was not enlivened by grace. This is what a Gloss says: <i>nothing is good without the supreme good</i>, i.e., no good is meritorious without God\u2019s grace, and <i>where knowledge of eternal life and unchangeable truth is lacking</i>, which knowledge comes by faith, <i>virtue in the best behavior is false</i>, inasmuch as it is not referred to the end of eternal happiness. But when an unbeliever does something from the fact that he is an unbeliever, it is clear that he sins. Hence when a Gloss says: <i>every deed which is not from faith is a sin</i>, it must be understood in the following way: Everything against faith or against conscience is a sin, and if it seems of its nature to be good, as when a pagan in honor of his gods preserves virginity or gives an alms, he sins by this very fact: <i>to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure; their very minds and consciences are corrupted</i> (Titus 1:15)."

Hence he says: not only should we avoid scandalizing the weak, but <b><i>we who are stronger</i></b> in faith <b><i>ought to bear the infirmities of the weak</i></b>. For as in a material edifice certain stronger material is selected to support the edifice\u2019s entire weight, upon which weaker material is set, as are the foundation and pillars, so in the spiritual edifice of the Church stronger men are not only chosen but made stronger to support the weight of the others. Hence it says in a psalm: <i>I have strengthened its pillars</i> (Ps 75:4) and in Galatians: <i>bear one another\u2019s burdens</i> (Gal 6:2). But the stronger support the failings of the weak, when they endure the shortcomings of the weak patiently and, so far as they can, try to help them."

It is considered unforgivable both in this life and in the future, because the Jews were punished for this sin even in this life by the Romans and in the life to come by devils; or because it has no basis for being excused, unlike the blasphemy they spoke against Christ, inasmuch as he was a son of man: <i>behold a glutton and a drunkard</i> (Matt 11:19). They could have been led to say this on account of the weakness of the flesh, as occurred even in the Old Testament, when the children of Israel complained about the lack of bread and water, as we read in Exodus (16:2 et seq.). This could be considered a human failing and easy to forgive. But later on when they declared before an idol: <i>these are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt</i> (Exod 32:4), they sinned against the Holy Spirit, for they attributed God\u2019s work to demons. Hence their sin is called unforgivable, when the Lord answers: <i>nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them</i> (Exod 32:34)."

For a person possessing scientific philosophical knowledge is inclined to assent to its statements for one reason, namely, through demonstration, but one having the habit of opinion is inclined to assent for a different reason, namely, through a dialectical syllogism."

For at that time men did not believe that God would punish or reward men\u2019s actions: <i>he walks about the poles of heaven, nor does he consider our things</i> (Job 22:14). But after the law was given by God, it was recognized that sins are imputed by God for punishment and not only by men.

Over such, therefore, death, i.e., sin, reigned completely, because it possessed them entirely.

In this way, one is under the law when he does not obey it voluntarily from love but is compelled by fear. But such a one lacks grace which, if it were present, would incline the will to observe the law and fulfill its moral precepts from a motive of love. Therefore, as long as one is under the law in such a way that he does not fulfill it voluntarily, sin has dominion over him. As a result, such a man\u2019s will is inclined to choose what is contrary to the law. But through grace such dominion is removed; consequently, a man observes the law not as existing under the law but as free: <i>we are not children of the slave but of the free woman, by the freedom with which Christ has set us free</i> (Gal 4:31)."

He speaks this way to show how great in him is the strength of divine love, and to lay everything out in the open. For this is the way of lovers, that they cannot hide their love in silence but assert and bare it to their friends and to the beloved, and they cannot confine the flames within their heart. They speak of them frequently, so that by constantly recounting their love they may gain some relief, some cooling of the tremendous burning within them. In just this way, blessed Paul here acts as an outstanding lover of Christ: he gathers up in one sentence all things that are and that were, everything that can be and even those that cannot.
