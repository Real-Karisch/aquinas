  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>7:10</sup> But to them who are married, not I, but the Lord, commands that the wife depart not from her husband.<br><sup>7:11</sup> And if she departs, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife.<br><sup>7:12</sup> For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother has a wife who believes not and she consents to dwell with him: let him not put her away.<br><sup>7:13</sup> And if any woman has a husband who believes not and he consents to dwell with her: let her not put away her husband.<br><sup>7:14</sup> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife: and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband. Otherwise your children should be unclean: but now they are holy.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>7:15</sup> But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases. But God has called us in peace.<br><sup>7:16</sup> For how do you know, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? Or how do you know, O man, whether you shall save your wife?<br><sup>7:17</sup> But as the Lord has distributed to every one, as God has called every one: so let him walk. And so in all churches I teach.<br><sup>7:18</sup> Is any man called, being circumcised? Let him not procure uncircumcision. Is any man called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.<br><sup>7:19</sup> Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance of the commandments of God.<br><sup>7:20</sup> Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture4.html"><sup>7:21</sup> Were you called, being a slave? Care not for it: but if you can become made free, rather use it.<br><sup>7:22</sup> For he who is called in the Lord, being a slave, is the freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who is called, being free, is the slave of Christ.<br><sup>7:23</sup> You are bought with a price: do not become the slaves of men.<br><sup>7:24</sup> Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture5.html"><sup>7:25</sup> Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.<br><sup>7:26</sup> I think therefore that this is good on account of the pressing necessity: because it is good for a man to be so.<br><sup>7:27</sup> Are you bound to a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.<br><sup>7:28</sup> But if you take a wife, you have not sinned. And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned: nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh. But I spare you.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture6.html"><sup>7:29</sup> This therefore I say, brethren: the time is short. It remains that they also who have wives be as if they had none:<br><sup>7:30</sup> And they that weep, as though they wept not: and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not: and they that buy as if they possessed not:<br><sup>7:31</sup> And they that use this world, as if they used it not. For the form of this world passes away.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture7.html"><sup>7:32</sup> But I would have you be without solicitude. He who is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord: how he may please God.<br><sup>7:33</sup> But he who is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the world: how he may please his wife.<br><sup>7:34</sup> And he is divided. And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinks on the things of the Lord: that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married thinks on the things of the world: how she may please her husband.<br><sup>7:35</sup> And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is noble and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture8.html"><sup>7:36</sup> But if any man thinks that he seems dishonored with regard to his virgin, because she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what she wills. He does not sin if she marries.<br><sup>7:37</sup> For he who has determined, being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of her own will: and has judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, does well.<br><sup>7:38</sup> Therefore both he who gives his virgin in marriage does well: and he who does not give her does better.<br><sup>7:39</sup> A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband lives: but if her husband has fallen asleep, she is at liberty. Let her marry to whom she wills: only in the Lord.<br><sup>7:40</sup> But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel. And I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</a>
