    <b>336.</b> After presenting teachings about the contract of marriage, the Apostle now instructs those who have already contracted marriage, that they must not dissolve the marriage.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he teaches those already joined in marriage to continue in it;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he gives them a useful teaching as to all the states or conditions of men, at <b><i>as God has called everyone: so let him walk</i></b> (1 Cor 7:17).
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he deals with the indissolubility of marriage, as it applies to those who are of one worship;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, when there is disparity of cult, at <b><i>for to the rest I speak</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he lays down a precept about the indissolubility of marriage;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he teaches what should be done when the marriage is broken by separation, at <b><i>and if she departs</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph337"></span>
    <b>337.</b> First, therefore, he says: I have said to the unmarried, i.e., virgins and widows, that it is better for them to remain as they are;<b> <i>but to them who are married</i></b>, the same condition does not prevail. For to them I give the charge, <b><i>not I</i></b>, by the authority entrusted to me,<b> <i>but the Lord</i></b> commands this.
