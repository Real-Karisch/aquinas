  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>7:1</sup> Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman.<br><sup>7:2</sup> But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife: and let every woman have her own husband.<br><sup>7:3</sup> Let the husband render the debt to his wife: and the wife also in like manner to the husband.<br><sup>7:4</sup> The wife has not power of her own body: but the husband. And in like manner the husband also has not power of his own body: but the wife.<br><sup>7:5</sup> Do not defraud one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer: and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.<br><sup>7:6</sup> But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment.<br><sup>7:7</sup> For I would that all were even as myself. But every one has his proper gift from God: one after this manner, and another after that.<br><sup>7:8</sup> But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: it is good for them if they so continue, even as I.<br><sup>7:9</sup> But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burnt.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>7:10</sup> But to them who are married, not I, but the Lord, commands that the wife depart not from her husband.<br><sup>7:11</sup> And if she departs, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife.<br><sup>7:12</sup> For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother has a wife who believes not and she consents to dwell with him: let him not put her away.<br><sup>7:13</sup> And if any woman has a husband who believes not and he consents to dwell with her: let her not put away her husband.<br><sup>7:14</sup> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife: and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband. Otherwise your children should be unclean: but now they are holy.</a>
