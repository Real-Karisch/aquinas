    <b>139.</b> After describing the status of God’s ministers, the Apostle now discusses their reward.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he discusses the reward of good ministers;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, the punishment of evil ones, at <b><i>know you not that you are the temple of God</i> </b>(1 Cor 3:16).
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does three things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he mentions the reward reserved for ministers;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he assigns the reason, at <b><i>for we are God’s fellow workers</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, the variety of rewards, at <b><i>according to the grace of God</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph140"></span>
    <b>140.</b> He says, therefore: I have said that <b><i>neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters</i></b> (1 Cor 3:7); nevertheless, he does not plant or water in vain, but<b> <i>every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labor</i></b>. For although God alone gives the increase and he alone works from within, he gives a reward to those who labor outwardly: <i>let your voice cease from weeping, and your eyes from tears: for there is a reward for your work</i> (Jer 31:16); this reward is God himself: <i>I am your protector and your reward exceedingly great</i> (Gen 15:1). It is for this reward that the laborers are praised: <i>how many hired servants in my father’s house abound with bread!</i> (Luke 15:17). On the other hand, if he works for any other reward, he is not worthy of praise: <i>but the hireling, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep</i> (John 10:12).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph141"></span>
    <b>141.</b> But this reward is both common to all and peculiar to each: it is common, because what they all see and enjoy is the same God: <i>then shall you abound in delights in the Almighty, and you shall lift up your face to God</i> (Job 22:26); <i>in that day the Lord of hosts shall be a crown of glory, and a garland of joy to the residue of his people</i> (Isa 28:5). This is why all the laborers in the vineyard receive one penny (Matt 20:9ff).
    <br />
    <br />
    But the reward will be peculiar to each, because one sees more clearly and enjoys more fully than another according to the measure established for all eternity. Whence they who are learned, are compared to the splendor of the firmament, who unto justice instruct many as though stars. This is why it says in John: <i>in my Father’s house there are many mansions</i> (John 14:2). For the same reason he says here: <b><i>every man shall receive his own reward</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph142"></span>
    <b>142.</b> But he indicates the basis for the various rewards when he adds, <b><i>according to his own labor</i></b>: <i>you shall eat the labors of you hands; blessed are you and it shall be well with you</i> (Ps 128:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    But this does not mean an equal amount of reward for a corresponding amount of labor, because as it is said: <i>for that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulations, works for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory</i> (2 Cor 4:17); rather, it means a proportional equality, so that where the labor is greater the reward is greater.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph143"></span>
    <b>143.</b> Now there are three ways in which the labor can be considered greater: first, by reason of charity, to which the essential aspect of the reward corresponds, i.e., the enjoyment and sight of God; hence it says in John: <i>he who loves me will be loved of my Father; and I will love him and will manifest myself to him</i> (John 14:21). Consequently, one who labors with greater love, even though he endures less difficulties, will receive more of the essential reward.
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, by reason of the type of work: for just as in human enterprises a person gets a higher wage for a higher type of work, as the architect gets more than the manual laborer, although he does less bodily work, so too in divine matters; a person occupied in a nobler work will receive a greater reward consisting in some special prerogative of the accidental reward, even though he might perhaps have done less bodily labor; hence a special crown is given to teachers, to virgins and to martyrs.
    <br />
    <br />
    Third, by reason of the amount of labor, which happens in two ways: for sometimes a greater labor deserves a greater reward, especially in regard to lightening punishment; as when a person fasts longer or undertakes a longer pilgrimage: and even in regard to the joy he will experience for the greater labor: <i>he renders to the just the wages of their labors</i> (Wis 10:17). But sometimes there is greater labor because of a lack of will; for in things we do of our own will, we experience less labor. In this case the amount of labor will not increase but lessen the reward; hence Isaiah says: <i>they shall take wings as eagles: they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint</i> (Isa 40:31); but prior to this he said: <i>youths shall faint and labor</i> (Isa 1:30).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph144"></span>
    <b>144.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>for we are God’s</i></b>, he assigns the reason for what he had said.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he gives the reason;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he applies a simile, at <b><i>you are God’s husbandry</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph145"></span>
    <b>145.</b> He says, therefore: it is only right that each of us shall receive a reward, <b><i>for we are God’s fellow workers</i></b>, namely, by their labors.
    <br />
    <br />
    But he seems to be contradicted by Job: <i>whose helper are you? Is it of him who is weak?</i> (Job 26:2); <i>who has helped the Spirit of the Lord?</i> (Is 40:13).
    <br />
    <br />
    The answer is that one helps another in two ways: in one way by increasing his strength. In this way no one can be God’s helper; hence after the above Job continues, <i>and do you hold up the arm of him that has no strength?</i> The other way is by serving in another’s work, as when a minister is called a master’s helper or an artisan’s helper, inasmuch as he does some work for him. In this way God’s ministers are his coadjutors: <i>and we helping do exhort you</i> (2 Cor 6:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, just as men’s ministers receive a reward from them according to their labor, so, too, God’s minister.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph146"></span>
    <b>146.</b> Second, he makes use of a simile referring to simple works, namely, agriculture and building. For the faithful are a field cultivated by God, inasmuch as through God’s action they produce the fruit of good works acceptable to God: <i>that you may belong to another, who is risen again from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit to God</i> (Rom 7:4); and in John it says: <i>my Father is the husbandman</i> (John 15:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    And this is what he says first: <b><i>you are God’s husbandry</i></b>, i.e., like a field cultivated by God and bearing his fruit. The faithful are also like a house built by God, inasmuch as God lives in them: <i>you also are built together into a habitation of God in the Spirit</i> (Eph 2:22).
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, he continues: <b><i>you are God’s building</i></b>, i.e., an edifice constructed by God: <i>unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain who build it</i> (Ps 127:1). In these ways, then, God’s ministers are coadjutors, inasmuch as they labor in cultivating and guiding the faithful.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph147"></span>
    <b>147.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>according to the grace of God</i></b>, he discusses the varieties of reward; and because rewards are distinguished according to the varieties of labor.
    <br />
    <br />
    First he deals with the varieties of labor;
    <br />
    <br />
    second with the diverse reward, at <b><i>now, if any man builds upon</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he distinguishes the varieties of labor;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he sounds a warning, at <b><i>but let every man take heed</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph148"></span>
    <b>148.</b> In regard to the first he does two things: first, abandoning the simile based on agriculture, he describes his own labor under the likeness of a building, saying, <b><i>according to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    Here it should be noted that an architect, especially of a building, is called the chief artisan, inasmuch as it is his duty to comprehend the entire arrangement of the whole work, which is brought to completion by the activities of the manual laborers. Consequently, he is called wise in building, because he who is wise, simply speaking, considers the highest cause, namely God, and orders all other things according to God. Thus, he who is called wise in building considers the principal cause of the building, i.e., its end, and arranges what is to be done by the subordinate artisans to realize the end.
    <br />
    <br />
    Now it is obvious that the entire structure of a building depends on the foundation; consequently, it pertains to a wise architect to lay a solid foundation. But Paul himself laid the foundation of the spiritual edifice for the Corinthians; hence he said above, <b><i>I have planted</i> </b>(1 Cor 3:6), for planting is related to plants as the foundations to buildings,
    <br />
    <br />
    because both signify expressly the first preaching of the faith: <i>I have preached this Gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation</i> (Rom 15:20). This is why he compares himself to a wise architect.
    <br />
    <br />
    But he attributes this not to his own power but to God’s grace; which is what he says, <b><i>according to the grace of God that is given to me</i></b>, who made me fit and worthy for this ministry: <b><i>I have labored more abundantly than all they. Yet not I, but the grace of God with me</i></b> (1 Cor 15:10).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph149"></span>
    <b>149.</b> Second, he describes others’ labors, saying, <b><i>and another</i></b>, i.e., whoever labors among you,<b> <i>builds thereon</i></b> the foundation laid by me.
    <br />
    <br />
    This can be done in two ways: in one way so that each person builds on the faith produced in him by growing in charity and good works: <i>be you also as living stone built up</i> (1 Pet 2:5). In another way by doctrine, whereby one explains more clearly the faith produced in others: <i>to build and to plant</i> (Jer 1:10). In this interpretation the building up signifies the same thing as watering signified.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph150"></span>
    <b>150.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>but let every man take heed</i></b>, he gives a warning, saying: I have said that it pertains to others to build on the foundation: <b><i>but let every man take heed</i></b>, i.e., pay careful attention to<b> <i>how he builds thereupon</i></b>, i.e., what sort of doctrine he adds to the faith already existing in others or what sort of works to the faith existing in himself: <i>let your eyes look straight on, and let your eyelids go before your steps</i> (Prov 4:25).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph151"></span>
    <b>151.</b> Second, he answers a tacit question: why he warns them about the superstructure and not the foundations; or rather, he states the reason why he said that the task of others is to build on the foundation. He says: <b><i>for another foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid: which is Christ Jesus</i></b>, who dwells in your heart by faith: of the foundation it is said (Isa 28:16): <i>behold, I will lay a stone in the foundations of Zion, a tried stone, a corner stone, a precious stone, founded in the foundation</i>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph152"></span>
    <b>152.</b> On the other hand it seems that Christ is not the sole foundation, because: <i>the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the twelve names of the twelve apostles</i> (Rev 21:14).
    <br />
    <br />
    The answer is that there are two kinds of foundations: one is solid of itself, such as the rock on which the building is constructed. This is the foundation to which Christ is compared; for he is the rock mentioned in Matthew: <i>for it was founded on a rock</i> (Matt 7:25). The other is the foundation, which is not solid of itself but rests on a solid object, as the stones placed on solid rock. This is the way the apostles are called the foundation of the Church, because they were the first to be built on Christ by faith and charity: <i>built on the foundation of the apostles</i> (Eph 2:20).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph153"></span>
    <b>153.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>now, if any man builds</i></b>, he discusses the variety of rewards accordingly as some receive a wage without any loss and some with a loss.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does three things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he teaches that a variety of works is revealed by the wages;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, when this is revealed, at <b><i>for the day of the Lord</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, how it is revealed, at <b><i>if any man’s work abides</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph154"></span>
    <b>154.</b> As to the first it should be noted that the Apostle, in order to point out the varieties of superstructures, mentions six things, i.e., three against three: on the one hand, <b><i>gold</i></b>, <b><i>silver</i></b> and <b><i>precious stones</i></b>; on the other hand, <b><i>wood</i></b>, <b><i>hay</i> </b>and<b> <i>stubble</i></b>. The first three have a striking brilliance, as well as being indestructible and precious; but the other three are, easily consumed by fire and worthless. Hence by <b><i>gold</i></b>, <b><i>silver</i></b> and <b><i>precious stones</i> </b>are understood something brilliant and lasting; but by <b><i>wood</i></b>,<b> <i>hay</i></b> and <b><i>stubble</i></b> something material and transitory.
    <br />
    <br />
    Now he stated above that the superstructure can refer either to the works everyone builds on the foundation of faith or to the doctrine which a teacher or preacher builds on the foundation of faith laid by an apostle. Hence, the variety the Apostle mentions here can refer to both superstructures.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph155"></span>
    <b>155.</b> Therefore, some, referring this to the superstructure of works, have said the <b><i>gold</i></b>, <b><i>silver</i></b> and<b> <i>precious stones</i> </b>mean the good works a person adds to his faith; but wood, hay, and stubble mean the mortal sins a person commits after receiving the faith. However, this interpretation cannot stand.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, because mortal sins are dead works: <i>he will cleanse our consciences from dead works</i> (Heb 9:14), whereas only living works are built onto this building: <i>be you also as living stone built up</i> (1 Pet 2:5). Consequently, those who have mortal sins along with faith do not build up, but rather destroy or profane. Against such persons he says: <b><i>but if any man violates the temple of God, him shall God destroy</i></b> (1 Cor 3:17).
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, because mortal sins are better compared to iron or lead or stone, since they are heavy and not destroyed by fire but always remain in the thing in which they exist; whereas venial sins are compared to <b><i>wood</i></b>, <b><i>hay</i></b>, and <b><i>stubble</i></b>, because they are light and easily cleansed from a person by fire.
    <br />
    <br />
    Third, because it seems to follow from this interpretation that a person who dies in mortal sin, as long as he keeps the faith, will finally attain to salvation after undergoing punishment. For he continues: <b><i>if any man’s work burns, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire</i></b>, which is obviously contrary to the Apostle’s statement below: <b><i>neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers . . . shall posses the kingdom of God</i> </b>(1 Cor 6:9–10), and to the Galatians: <i>those who do such things shall not possess the kingdom of God</i> (Gal 5:21). But one possesses salvation only in the kingdom of God; for everyone excluded from it is sent into eternal fire (Matt 25:41).
    <br />
    <br />
    Fourth, because faith can be called a foundation, only because by it Christ dwells in us, since it was stated that the foundation is Christ Jesus himself. For Christ does not dwell in us by unformed faith; otherwise he would dwell in the devils, of whom James says: <i>the devils believe and tremble</i> (Jas 2:19). Hence Ephesians says: <i>that Christ by faith may dwell in your hearts</i> (Eph 3:17). This should be understood of faith informed by charity, since 1 John says: <i>he who abides in love abides in God and God in him</i> (1 John 4:16). This is the faith that works through love, as it says below: <b><i>charity deals not perversely</i> </b>(1 Cor 13:4). Consequently, it is obvious that persons who commit mortal sins do not have formed faith, and so do not have the foundation.
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, it is necessary to suppose that the person who builds upon the foundation <b><i>gold</i></b>, <b><i>silver</i></b> and <b><i>precious stones</i></b>, as well as one who builds upon it <b><i>wood</i></b>, <b><i>hay</i></b>, <b><i>stubble</i></b>, avoids mortal sin.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph156"></span>
    <b>156.</b> Therefore to understand the difference between these two sets of things, it should be noted that human acts are characterized by their objects.
    <br />
    <br />
    But there are two objects of a human act: a spiritual thing and a bodily thing. Now these objects differ in three ways: first, spiritual things last forever, but bodily things pass away; hence it is said: <i>the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal</i> (2 Cor 4:18). Second, spiritual things are brilliant in themselves: <i>wisdom is glorious and never fades away</i> (Wis 6:13), but bodily things on account of their matter are dingy: <i>our time is as the passing of a shadow</i> (Wis 2:5). Third, spiritual are more precious and nobler than bodily things: <i>wisdom is more precious than all riches</i> (Prov 3:15); <i>all gold in comparison of her, is as a little sand: and silver in comparison to her shall be counted as clay</i> (Wis 7:9).
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, the works that engage a person in spiritual and divine things are compared to <b><i>gold</i></b>, <b><i>silver</i></b> and <b><i>precious stones</i></b>, which are firm, bright, and precious. By <b><i>gold</i></b> are signified those by which a man tends to God himself by contemplation and love. Hence it is said: <i>his head is as the finest gold</i> (Song 5:11); for the head of Christ is God, and the gold is that mentioned in Revelation: <i>therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold tried by fire</i> (Rev 3:18), i.e., wisdom with charity. By <b><i>silver</i></b> are signified those acts by which a man clings to spiritual things to believe, love, and contemplate them; hence in a Gloss the silver is referred to as love of neighbor, and in a psalm the wings of a dove are described as covered with silver and its pinions with green gold (Ps 68:13). But<b> <i>precious stones</i></b> signify the works of the various virtues with which the soul is adorned; hence it says in Sirach: <i>like a vessel of hammered gold adorned with all kinds of precious stones</i> (Sir 50:9), or they signify the commandments of God’s law: <i>therefore I love your commandments above gold, above fine gold</i> (Ps 119:127).
    <br />
    <br />
    But the human acts by which a person aims at acquiring bodily things are compared to tinder, which is worthless; for although it has a sheen, it burns easily. Yet there are various kinds, some of which are stronger than others are some are more easily burned. For among bodily creatures men are the more noble and conserved by succession; hence they are compared to <b><i>wood</i></b>: <i>the trees once went forth to anoint a king over them</i> (Judg 9:8). But man’s flesh is easily destroyed by sickness and death; hence he is compared to <b><i>hay</i></b>: <i>all flesh is hay</i> (Isa 49:6). Again, the things which contribute to the glory of this world quickly pass away; hence they are compared to <b><i>stubble</i></b>: <i>O my God, make them like a tumbleweed, like stubble before the wind</i> (Ps 83:13).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph157"></span>
    <b>157.</b> And so when one builds thereon <b><i>gold</i> </b>and <b><i>silver</i> </b>and<b> <i>precious stones</i></b>, he builds upon the foundation of faith those things which pertain to contemplating the wisdom of divine matters, to loving God, to performing devout exercises, to helping his neighbor and performing virtuous works.
    <br />
    <br />
    But to build upon it <b><i>wood, hay</i></b>, and<b> <i>stubble</i></b> is to erect on the foundation of faith things which pertain to arranging human affairs, to caring for the flesh and for outward glory.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph158"></span>
    <b>158.</b> However, it should be noted that there are three possible attitudes, when a person intends these latter things: first, he might make them an end. Since this would be a mortal sin, a person with such an attitude would not be building upon the foundation by laying another foundation: for the end is the foundation for the desirable things sought for its sake.
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, a person might tend toward these things, directing them entirely to the glory of God; and because they are qualified by the end one intends, a person with such an attitude will not be building <b><i>wood</i></b>, <b><i>hay</i></b>, and<b> <i>stubble</i></b> on the foundation but <b><i>gold</i></b>, <b><i>silver</i></b>, and<b> <i>precious stones</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    Third, a person could have the attitude that although he is not making these things an end or would act contrary to God for their sake, nevertheless he is drawn toward them more than he ought, so that he is kept back from the things of God by them; which is to sin venially. And this is what is meant by building <b><i>wood</i></b>, <b><i>hay</i></b>, and <b><i>stubble</i></b> on the foundation; not because they are, properly speaking, erected on the foundation, but because acts of caring about temporal things have venial sins attached to them due to a stronger attachment to them. This attachment is compared to <b><i>wood</i></b>, <b><i>hay</i></b> or <b><i>stubble</i></b>, depending on how strong it is.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph159"></span>
    <b>159.</b> Yet is should be kept in mind that those who tend after spiritual things cannot be altogether freed from caring for temporal things, any more than those who tend after temporal things from a duty of charity are altogether free from tending toward spiritual things. The difference is one of emphasis: for some emphasize spiritual things and make no provision for temporal things, except as the needs of bodily life require; others place the emphasis in their lives on procuring temporal things, but use spiritual things to direct their life. The first group, therefore, builds <b><i>gold</i></b>, <b><i>silver</i></b>, and<b> <i>precious stones</i></b>; but the second <b><i>hay</i></b>, <b><i>wood</i></b>, and <b><i>stubble</i></b> on the foundation.
    <br />
    <br />
    From this it is clear that the former have some venials but not a notable amount, because they are only slightly concerned with the care of temporal things; but the latter have something stable, precious and brilliant, but only a small amount, namely, to the extent that they are directed by spiritual considerations.

    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph160"></span>
    <b>160.</b> They can also be differentiated on the basis of doctrine. For some, by teaching sound, true, and clear doctrine, erect <b><i>gold</i></b>, <b><i>silver</i></b>, and<b> <i>precious stones</i></b> upon the foundation of faith laid by the apostles; hence it says in Proverbs: <i>the tongue of the righteous is choice silver</i> (Prov 10:20). On the other hand, those who add to the faith laid down by the apostles doctrines that are useless, unclear or not supported by true reasons, but vain and empty, erect <b><i>wood</i></b>, <b><i>hay</i></b>, and <b><i>stubble</i></b>, hence it is said: <i>let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat?</i> <i>Says the Lord</i> (Jer 23:28). Finally those who teach falsehood do not build on the foundation but subvert it.

    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph161"></span>
    <b>161.</b> He says, therefore: <b><i>if any man builds</i> </b>by his works or teachings <b><i>upon this foundation</i></b>, i.e., upon the formed faith in his heart or upon the faith founded and taught by the apostles, <b><i>gold, silver</i></b>, or <b><i>precious stones</i></b>, i.e., spiritual works or sound, clear teachings, or<b> <i>wood, hay, stubble</i></b>, i.e., corporal works or silly teachings, <b><i>every man’s work shall be manifest</i></b>, i.e., in the divine judgment, it will be manifest <b><i>what sort it is</i></b>: for man’s ignorance of it will not keep it hidden forever. For some appear to be erecting <b><i>gold</i></b>, <b><i>silver</i></b>, and <b><i>precious stones</i></b>, who are nevertheless erecting <b><i>wood</i></b>, <b><i>hay</i></b>, and <b><i>stubble</i></b> by looking for temporal benefits, such as profit or human favor, from spiritual things. Others, however, seem to be erecting <b><i>wood</i></b>, <b><i>hay</i></b>, and <b><i>stubble</i></b>, but are really erecting <b><i>gold</i></b>, <b><i>silver</i></b>, and <b><i>precious stones</i></b>, because in administering temporal things they have their eye on spiritual things alone. Hence it is said: <i>I will search Jerusalem with lamps</i> (Zeph 1:12) and in Luke: <i>nothing is covered up that will not be revealed</i> (Luke 12:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph162"></span>
    <b>162.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>for the day for the Lord</i></b>, he shows when these things will be disclosed.
    <br />
    <br />
    And first he specifies the time of manifestation, when he says, <b><i>the day of the Lord shall declare it</i></b>. Here it should be noted that the time and day of a thing is said to be present when it exists in its best state and in the fullness of its power. This is the sense in which <i>all things have their season</i> (Eccl 3:1). Therefore, when a man is fulfilling his will even contrary to God, it is man’s day. Hence it is said: <i>you know that I have not desired the day of man</i> (Jer 17:16). But it is the day of the Lord, when his will is accomplished in regard to men, who are rewarded or punished according to his justice: <i>at the set time which I appoint I will judge with equity</i> (Ps 73:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    Hence the day of the Lord can be taken in three senses, depending on the three times the Lord will judge.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph163"></span>
    <b>163.</b> For there will be a general judgment of all man, as it says in Matthew: <i>the men of Nineveh will arise at the judgment</i> (Matt 12:41). In this sense the day of the Lord will be the last day—judgment day—alluded to in 2 Thessalonians: <i>be not terrified as if the day of the Lord were at hand</i> (2 Thess 2:2). This is the interpretation of the statement that <b><i>the day of the Lord shall declare it</i></b>, because on the day of judgment the differences among men’s merits will be disclosed: <i>on that day when God judges the secrets of men by Jesus Christ</i> (Rom 2:16).
    <br />
    <br />
    Another is the particular judgment, which takes place for each person at his death. Luke says of this judgment: <i>the rich man died and was buried in hell; and the poor man also died and was carried to Abraham’s bosom</i> (Luke 16:22). In this sense the day of the Lord refers to the day of death, as in 1 Thessalonians: <i>the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night</i> (1 Thess 5:2). <b><i>The day of the Lord shall declare it</i></b>, because every man’s merits will be plain at his death. Hence it says in Proverbs: <i>when the wicked dies, his hope perishes</i> (Prov 11:7) and in Proverbs: <i>the righteous man has hope when he dies</i> (Prov 14:32).
    <br />
    <br />
    The third judgment takes place in this life, inasmuch as God sometimes proves a man by the tribulations of this life; hence it says below: <b><i>but while we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world</i> </b>(1 Cor 11:32). In this sense, temporal tribulations are called <b><i>the day of the Lord</i></b>: <i>the sound of the day of the Lord is bitter, the mighty man cries aloud there</i> (Zeph 1:14). Therefore, <b><i>the day of the Lord shall declare</i></b>, because during the time of tribulation a man’s affections are tested: <i>the kiln tests the potter’s vessels; so the trial of affliction just men</i> (Sir 27:5).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph164"></span>
    <b>164.</b> Second, he shows the means by which it will be disclosed, namely, by fire; hence he continues: <b><i>because it shall be revealed in fire</i></b>, namely, <b><i>the day of the Lord</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    For the day of judgment will be revealed in the fire which will precede the face of the judge, burning the face of the world, enveloping the wicked and cleansing the just. A psalm says of this: <i>fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries round about</i> (Ps 96:3). But the day of the Lord which occurs at death will be revealed in the fire of purgatory, by which the elect will be cleansed, if any require cleansing: Job can be interpreted as referring to this fire: <i>when he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold</i> (Job 23:10). Finally, the day of the Lord, which is the day of tribulation permitted by God’s judgment, will be revealed in the fire of tribulation: <i>for gold is tested in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation</i> (Sir 2:5).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph165"></span>
    <b>165.</b> Third, he mentions the effect of the disclosure when he says, <b><i>and the fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it is</i></b>, namely, because each of these fires will prove a man’s merits or demerits: <i>if you test me, you will find no wickedness in me</i> (Ps 17:3).
    <br />
    <br />
    In these three events mentioned by the Apostle, the first is the conclusion of the two which follow: for if the day of the Lord will be revealed in fire, and if the fire tests the quality of a man’s work, the consequence is that the day of the Lord will disclose the differences among men’s works.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph166"></span>
    <b>166.</b> Then when he says,<b> <i>if any man’s work abides</i></b>, he indicates the manner in which the above disclosures will be made.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, in regard to good works when he says, <b><i>if any man’s work</i></b>, <b><i>which he has built thereupon</i></b>, <b><i>abides</i></b> the fire,<b> <i>he</i></b>, i.e., the one who erected it, <b><i>shall receive a reward</i></b>: <i>there is a reward for your work</i> (Jer 31:16); <i>behold, his reward is with him</i> (Isa 40:10).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph167"></span>
    <b>167.</b> One’s work is said to abide unharmed by the fire in two ways: in one way on the part of the worker, because the one performing the work, say of good teachings or any good work, is not punished for such works by the fire of purgatory or by the fire which goes before the face of the judge or even by the fire of tribulation. For a person who has not loved temporal things immoderately is not excessively saddened at their loss, because sadness is caused by one’s love of a thing which is lost; hence superfluous love produces sorrow.
    <br />
    <br />
    In another way on the part of the work itself: for no matter which of the above fires tests a man, the work of good teachings abides as does any other good work. For when the fire of tribulation comes, a man does not depart from his good teachings or from any good work of virtue; rather, each of these abides as to its merit both in the fire of purgatory and in the fire which goes before the face of the judge.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph168"></span>
    <b>168.</b> Second, he shows the same thing in regard to evil works, saying, <b><i>if any man’s work burns</i> </b>because of any of the above fires, <b><i>he shall suffer loss</i></b> for doing them, but not to the point of damnation; hence he adds,<b> <i>but he himself shall be saved</i></b> with eternal salvation: <i>Israel is saved by the Lord with everlasting salvation</i> (Isa 45:17), <b><i>yet so as by fire</i></b>, which he previously endured either in this life or at the end of the world; hence it is said: <i>we went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us forth to a spacious place</i> (Ps 66:12); <i>when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you, for I am the Lord, your Savior</i> (Isa 43:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph169"></span>
    <b>169.</b> Now a man’s work is said to burn in two ways: in one way on the part of the worker, inasmuch as he is afflicted by the fire of tribulation on account of the immoderate attachment he has to earthly things and by the fire of purgatory or by the fire which goes before the face of the judge on account of venial sins, which he committed by caring for temporal things or even by the frivolous and vain things he taught.
    <br />
    <br />
    In another way a work burns in the fire on the part of the work itself, because when tribulation comes, a person cannot find time for foolish teaching or worldly works: <i>on that day all his plans perish</i> (Ps 146:4). Furthermore, the fire of purgatory or the fire which goes before the face of the judge will not leave any of these things to act as a remedy or as merit. Similarly, he suffers a loss in two ways: either because he is punished or because he loses what he accomplished. On this point it is said: <i>every product decays and ceases to exist, and the man who made it will pass away with it. And every excellent work shall be justified; and the worker thereof shall be honored therein</i> (Sir 14:19).
    <br />
    <br />
    The first of these refers to the person who erects <b><i>wood</i></b>, <b><i>hay</i></b>, and <b><i>stubble</i></b>, which is the work that burns in the fire; but the second refers to the person who erects <b><i>gold</i></b>, <b><i>silver</i></b>, and <b><i>precious stones</i></b>, which is the work that abides in the fire without any loss.
