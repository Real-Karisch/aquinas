  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>2:1</sup> And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ. [n. 73.]<br><sup>2:2</sup> For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ: and him crucified.<br><sup>2:3</sup> And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.<br><sup>2:4</sup> And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom. but in showing of the Spirit and power:<br><sup>2:5</sup> That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.<br><sup>2:6</sup> Yet we speak wisdom among the perfect: although not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to naught.<br><sup>2:7</sup> But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory:</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>2:8</sup> Which none of the princes of this world knew. For if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.<br><sup>2:9</sup> But, as it is written: <i>that eye has not seen, nor ear heard</i>: neither has it entered into the heart of man, what things God has prepared for those who love him.<br><sup>2:10</sup> But to us God has revealed them by his Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.<br><sup>2:11</sup> For what man knows the things of a man, except the spirit of a man which is in him? So the things also that are of God, no one knows, except the Spirit of God.<br><sup>2:12</sup> Now, we have not received the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God: that we may know the things that are given us from God.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>2:13</sup> Which things also we speak: not in the learned words of human wisdom, but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.<br><sup>2:14</sup> But the sensual man perceives not these things that are of the Spirit of God. For it is foolishness to him: and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.<br><sup>2:15</sup> But the spiritual man judges all things: and he himself is judged of no man.<br><sup>2:16</sup> For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</a>
