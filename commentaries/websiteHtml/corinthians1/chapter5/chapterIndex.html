  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>5:1</sup> It is absolutely heard that there is fornication among you and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens: that one should have his fatherâ€™s wife.<br><sup>5:2</sup> And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned: that he might be taken away from among you that has done this thing.<br><sup>5:3</sup> I indeed, absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that has so done,<br><sup>5:4</sup> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus:<br><sup>5:5</sup> To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>5:6</sup> Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven corrupts the whole lump?<br><sup>5:7</sup> Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For our pasch is Christ sacrificed.<br><sup>5:8</sup> Therefore, let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness: but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>5:9</sup> I wrote to you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators.<br><sup>5:10</sup> I do not mean with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or the extortioners or the servers of idols: otherwise you would need to go out of this world.<br><sup>5:11</sup> But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator or covetous or a server of idols or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.<br><sup>5:12</sup> For what is it to me to judge them that are without? Do you not judge them that are within?<br><sup>5:13</sup> For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves.</a>
