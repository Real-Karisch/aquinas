      <a href="#paragraph421"><sup>8:1</sup> Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols: we know we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up: but charity edifies. <i>(421)</i></a>
      <br />
      <a href="#paragraph424"><sup>8:2</sup> And if any man thinks that he knows any thing, he has not yet known as he ought to know. <i>(424)</i></a>
      <br />
      <a href="#paragraph426"><sup>8:3</sup> But if any man loves God, the same is known by him. <i>(426)</i></a>
      <br />
      <a href="#paragraph428"><sup>8:4</sup> But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one. <i>(428)</i></a>
      <br />
      <a href="#paragraph430"><sup>8:5</sup> For although there are those that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there are many gods and many lords): <i>(430)</i></a>
      <br />
      <sup>8:6</sup> Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we unto him: and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.
      <br />
      <a href="#paragraph431"><sup>8:7</sup> But there is not knowledge in every one. For some, being hitherto with conscience of the idol, eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol: and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. <i>(431)</i></a>
