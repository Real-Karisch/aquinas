  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>6:1</sup> Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust: and not before the saints?<br><sup>6:2</sup> Know you not that the saints shall judge this world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?<br><sup>6:3</sup> Know you not that we shall judge angels? How much more things of this world?<br><sup>6:4</sup> If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge who are the most despised in the Church.<br><sup>6:5</sup> I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man that is able to judge between his brethren?<br><sup>6:6</sup> But brother goes to law with brother: and that before unbelievers?</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>6:7</sup> Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?<br><sup>6:8</sup> But you do wrong and defraud: and that to your brethren.<br><sup>6:9</sup> Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers: nor the effeminate nor those who lie with men<br><sup>6:10</sup> Nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall possess the kingdom of God.<br><sup>6:11</sup> And such some of you were. But you are washed: but you are sanctified: but you are justified: in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God.<br><sup>6:12</sup> All things are lawful for me: but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful for me: but I will not be brought under the power of any.<br><sup>6:13</sup> Meat for the belly and the belly for the meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.<br>But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord: and the Lord for the body.</a>

  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>6:13</sup> Meat for the belly and the belly for the meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.<br>But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord: and the Lord for the body.<br><sup>6:14</sup> Now God has raised up the Lord and will raise us up also by his power.<br><sup>6:15</sup> Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot? Never!<br><sup>6:16</sup> Or know you not that he who is joined to a harlot is made one body? For <i>they shall be</i>, he says, <i>two in one flesh</i>.<br><sup>6:17</sup> But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<br><sup>6:18</sup> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is without the body: but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.<br><sup>6:19</sup> Or know you not that your members are the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God:<br>and you are not your own?<br><sup>6:20</sup> For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body.</a>
