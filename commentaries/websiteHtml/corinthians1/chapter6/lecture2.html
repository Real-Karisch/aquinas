    <b>277.</b> After rebuking the Corinthians for bringing their lawsuits before unbelieving judges, the Apostle now rebukes them for the judgments themselves.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to this he does two things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he states how they sinned in regard to judgments;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he clarifies what he had said, at <b><i>know you not that the unjust</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he rebukes them in something lawful in regard to judgment, but not expedient;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, in what is utterly unlawful, at <b><i>but you do wrong</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things.
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he rebukes them;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he rejects an excuse, at <b><i>why do you not rather take wrong</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph278"></span>
    <b>278.</b> First, therefore, he says: it has been stated that brother contends with brother in judgment. It is not only bad that you contend before unbelievers, but <b><i>already indeed</i></b>, after your conversion, <b><i>there is plainly a fault among you</i></b>, i.e., it is regarded as a failing, <b><i>that you have lawsuits one with another</i></b>, between whom there should be peace, because <i>the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to everyone</i> (2 Tim 2:24).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph279"></span>
    <b>279.</b> It appears from this, as a Gloss of Augustine says, <i>that it is a sin to have a lawsuit against anyone</i>; but this seems to be false. For if it is a sin to have a lawsuit, it seems to follow that it is also a sin to appoint judges, since this is tantamount to giving an occasion to those having lawsuits, whereas it is said: <i>hear the cases between your brethren and judge righteously</i> (Deut 1:16).
    <br />
    <br />
    For it is answered in a Gloss that the weak are permitted to seek their rights in a lawsuit, but not the perfect, who can lawfully seek their rights but not in a lawsuit.
    <br />
    <br />
    But it should be noted that one thing is lawful for the perfect and another thing for all others. The perfect, indeed, do not have anything they can call their own: <i>if you would be perfect, go see what you possess and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me</i> (Matt 19:21). Consequently, it is not lawful for them to seek in a lawsuit anything that can be considered their own, since it is not lawful for them to possess anything as their own, although they may seek common property in a lawsuit. For they do not sin in doing this, but rather they merit.
    <br />
    <br />
    For it is a work of charity to defend or recover the property of the poor, as it says in a psalm: <i>rescue the weak and the needy, deliver them from the hand of the wicked</i> (Ps 82:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    But a lawsuit against anyone is unlawful for four reasons. First, as to its cause on account of which one brings a lawsuit, say from covetousness and greed. Hence, when someone had said to the Lord: <i>bid my brother divide the inheritance with me</i>, the Lord said: <i>who made me judge or divider over you</i>; then he added: <i>take heed and beware of covetousness</i> ( Luke 12:13ff.).
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, in regard to the way a lawsuit is conducted, because it is conducted with strife and harm to peace: for as it is said: <i>where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice</i> (Jas 3:16). And this is what the Apostle seems to rebuke them for, as is clear from what he had said above:<b> <i>but brother goes to law with brother</i> </b>(1 Cor 6:6).
    <br />
    <br />
    Third, on account of the perversity of the judgment, say when someone proceeds unjustly and fraudulently in a lawsuit, as it is said: <i>you turn aside the needy from justice and rob the poor of my people of their right</i> (Isa 10:2). This, too, the Apostle reprehends in them, as he shows from what he adds, <b><i>but you do wrong and defraud</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    Fourth, on account of the scandal which follows. Hence the Lord commands: <i>if anyone would sue you and take your coat, let him have your cloak as well</i> (Matt 5:40).
    <br />
    <br />
    But out of charity it is lawful to seek your own in a lawsuit. Hence Gregory in <i>Morals</i>: <i>when necessity forces us to have charge of things, some are merely to be tolerated, when they demand things, but others to be forestalled, as long as charity is preserved, from snatching what is not theirs and thus destroying themselves</i>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph280"></span>
    <b>280.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>why do you not rather take wrong</i></b>, he takes away their excuse.
    <br />
    <br />
    For they could say a necessity forces us to have lawsuits in order to resist harm and dishonesty from other men. But he rejects this, as to the first, saying: <b><i>why do you not rather take wrong</i></b> by enduring it with patience, as the Lord says: <i>if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also</i> (Matt 5:31).
    <br />
    <br />
    As to the second he says, <b><i>why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded</i></b>, i.e., suffer the crafty wheedling, for it says: <i>if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him another two miles</i> (Matt 5:41). But, as Augustine says in <i>The Lord’s Sermon on the Mount</i>, these precepts of the Lord are not always to be observed in the performance of a work, but we should be prepared to obey them, so that we would be always prepared to do this or endure that, rather than do anything against fraternal charity.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph281"></span>
    <b>281.</b> Then when he says,<b> <i>but you do wrong</i></b>, he rebukes them for something altogether illicit.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he accuses them of obvious injustice, when he says: <b><i>but you do wrong</i></b>, namely, by speaking openly against the justice of others either in court or outside: <i>do not delight in what pleases the unjust</i> (Sir 9:12). Second, for crafty deception when he says: <b><i>and defraud</i></b>: <i>the counsels of the wicked are treacherous</i> (Prov 12:5). Third, he adds to the weight of both, when he adds, <b><i>and that to your own brethren</i></b>, i.e., believers to whom you should do good: <i>as we have opportunity, let us do good to all men, but especially to those who are of the household of the faith</i> (Gal 6:10). Therefore, it is said against some: <i>every brother is a supplanter, and every neighbor goes about as a slanderer</i> (Jer 9:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph282"></span>
    <b>282.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>know you not</i></b>, he clarifies what he had said.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, as to what is altogether unlawful;
    <br />
    <br />
    second as to what is unlawful but not expedient, at <b><i>all things are lawful for me</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he presents a question;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he answers it, at <b><i>do not err</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph283"></span>
    <b>283.</b> First, therefore, he says: I have stated that you do wrong and defraud, which is to commit sin, <b><i>know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God?</i></b> As if to say: you seem not to know this, as long as you do not give up your sin; whereas it it says in a psalm: <i>depart from me all you workers of evil</i> (Psalm 6:8).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph284"></span>
    <b>284.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>do not err</i></b>, he determines the truth.
    <br />
    <br />
    First he shows the impious their danger;
    <br />
    <br />
    second he shows how they were snatched from this peril and feared falling into it again, at <b><i>and such some of you were</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph285"></span>
    <b>285.</b> First, therefore, he says:<b> <i>do not err</i></b>, which is said with a purpose, because some have been deceived frequently about sinning with impunity: <i>thus they reasoned, but they were led astray</i> (Wis 2:21). For certain philosophers erred in believing that God does not have charge of human affairs: <i>the Lord will not do good, nor will he do ill</i> (Zeph 1:12). But others, believing that faith alone is sufficient for salvation: <i>whoever lives and believes in me shall never die</i> (John 11:26); others believing that they will be saved just by Christ’s sacraments, on account of which it says in Mark: <i>he who believes and is baptized will be saved</i> (Mark 16:16), and in John: <i>he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood will have eternal life</i> (John 6:55). Still others suppose that they can sin with impunity on account of the works of mercy they perform, inasmuch as it says in Luke: <i>give for alms those things which are within you; and behold, everything is clean for you</i> (Luke 11:40).
    <br />
    <br />
    But they do not understand that all these things are of no benefit without charity, for it says below: <b><i>if I should have all faith . . . and if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor . . . and have not charity, it profits me nothing</i></b> (1 Cor 13:2–3). Therefore, he continues: sins contrary to charity exclude one from the kingdom of God, which charity alone permits one to enter, saying, <b><i>neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers</i></b>, concerning whom it is said: <i>God will judge fornicators and adulterers</i> (Heb 13:4 ); <b><i>nor the effeminate</i></b>, i.e., males suffering in a womanly manner, <b><i>nor those who lie with men</i></b>, of which it is said: <i>the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord</i> (Gen 13:13); <b><i>nor theives nor the covetous</i></b>: <i>everyone that steals shall be cut off henceforth</i> (Zech 5:3);<b> <i>nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall possess the kingdom of God</i></b>. For it says in Isaiah: <i>and a highway shall be there, and it shall be called the Holy Way; the unclean shall not pass over it</i> (Isa 35:8); and in Revelation: <i>but nothing unclean shall enter it, nor anyone who practices abominations</i> (Rev 21:27).
    <br />
    <br />
    It should be noted that the vices mentioned here are the same as those mentioned in the previous chapter. But he added some in the category of lust, namely, adultery, and sins against nature, and thievery in the category of injustice.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph286"></span>
    <b>286.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>and such some of you were</i></b>, he shows how they escaped from the above-mentioned danger.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he reminds them of their past state, saying, <b><i>and such some of you were</i></b>, namely, fornicators and idolaters, etc. He makes particular mention of these vices, because they abounded in them, as it is said: <i>for once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord</i> (Eph 5:8).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph287"></span>
    <b>287.</b> Second, he shows how they were freed of them inwardly, saying, <b><i>but you are washed</i></b> by the power of Christ’s blood in baptism: <i>he freed us from our sins in his blood</i> (Rev 1:5). <b><i>But you are sanctified</i></b> by the power of Christ’s blood and consecrated in grace, as it is said: <i>so Jesus also suffered outside the gate, in order to sanctify the people through his own blood</i> (Heb 3:12). <b><i>But you are justified</i></b>, i.e., raised to the state of justice, according to Romans: <i>those whom he called he also justified</i> (Rom 8:30).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph288"></span>
    <b>288.</b> Then he mentions the cause of these blessings: first, on the part of the humanity of Christ when he says:<b> <i>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ</i></b>, i.e., in believing and calling on that name: <i>there is no other name under heaven given among men by which they must be saved</i> (Acts 4:12). Second, on the part of the divinity when he adds, <b><i>and the Spirit of our God</i></b>: <i>behold, I shall cause breath to enter you and you shall live</i> (Ezek 37:3). Therefore, since you have been freed by such great power, you should not return to the same former ways.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph289"></span>
    <b>289.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>all things are lawful for me</i></b>, he clarifies what he had said about forbidding lawsuits, and shows in what sense he rejects them, namely, he does not reject them as altogether unlawful, but as not expedient and as harmful.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to this he does two things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he states his proposition;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he assigns a reason, at <b><i>meat for the belly</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph290"></span>
    <b>290.</b> As to the first he does two things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he states that what he rejects is lawful but not expedient, saying, <b><i>all things are lawful for me</i></b>. Now those things are lawful which a man is not forbidden to do. But prohibitions are of two kinds: one is by force and the other by precept. According to this, some have understood that something is lawful from which they are not prohibited by any necessitating force; because man’s decision is naturally free of force, they understand the Apostle to mean it in that sense when he said: <b><i>all things are lawful for me</i></b>, namely, that all things are subject to man’s free choice, be they good or evil, according to what is said in Sirach: <i>before a man is life and death, good and evil, that which he chooses will be given to him</i> (Sir 15:17).
    <br />
    <br />
    But this way of speaking is alien to Sacred Scripture, in which it says that things forbidden by the divine law are not lawful: <i>it is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife</i> (Matt 14:4). Consequently, what the Apostle says here,<b> <i>all things are lawful for me</i></b>, must not be understood absolutely but in this sense: all things are lawful for me which are not forbidden by the divine law.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph291"></span>
    <b>291.</b> This can be referred to three things: first, to what he had said about lawsuits, namely, that it is lawful for anyone to obtain his property through lawsuits, since it is not forbidden by divine law. Second, it can be referred to what he will say below about indiscriminate use of food (1 Cor 8:8), so that the sense would be: it is lawful for me to eat all foods: <i>to the clean all things are clean</i> (Titus 1:15). Third, it can be referred to what he will say below about taking food and drink (1 Cor 9:4), so that the sense is this: <b><i>all things are lawful for me</i></b>, namely, to take what is necessary for life, just as it is for my co-apostles.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph292"></span>
    <b>292.</b> But he adds, <b><i>but all things are not expedient</i></b>. That is said to be expedient, which is without a hindrance to attaining an end. Now it happens that something does not entirely exclude the end, but it offers some hindrance, as marriage does not exclude a person from the kingdom of God, but it offers a hindrance, namely, because as it says below: <b><i>she who is married thinks on the things of the world: how she may please her husband</i></b> (1 Cor 7:34). Hence, <i>if the case of a man with his wife be so, it is not expedient to marry</i> (Matt 19:10). So fornication is neither lawful nor expedient, because it totally excludes one from the end, which is eternal life; but marriage is lawful but not expedient.
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, according to this mode, to get back one’s own in a lawsuit or to use all foods without distinction or to take one’s food from those to whom he preaches are all lawful, because they are not against justice or forbidden by any law; yet it is not expedient, either because peace towards one’s neighbor is endangered, or scandal of the weak is produced, or an occasion for reviling is offered: <i>not everything is good for everyone</i> (Sir 37:28).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph293"></span>
    <b>293.</b> In another way it can be understood not absolutely but conditionally, so that the sense is this: I have said that <b><i>neither fornicators nor idolaters . . . shall possess the kingdom of God</i></b>. Therefore they are not lawful, because they exclude the end; but if all things were licit for me, <b><i>all things are not expedient</i></b>, because they pose a hindrance to eternal life. Hence in the person of the wicked: <i>we took our fill of the power of lawlessness and destruction, and we journeyed through trackless deserts</i> (Wis 5:7).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph294"></span>
    <b>294.</b> Second, he shows that what he rejected above is harmful, saying, <b><i>all things are lawful for me: but I will not be brought under the power of any</i></b>, namely, man. For one who uses something not expedient, whether it be lawful or unlawful, is somehow put under the power of that man or thing. Of a thing, indeed, because one who loves a thing too much is made its slave, as it is said: <i>such persons do not serve the Lord Jesus Christ, but their own appetites</i> (Rom 16:18). But of a man, because as long as one does something not expedient, he is in thrall to the judgment of others; and particularly one who tries to get back his own in a lawsuit is under the power of the judge: <b><i>why is my liberty judged by another man’s conscience?</i></b> (1 Cor 10:29)
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph295"></span>
    <b>295.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>meat for the belly</i></b>, he assigns a reason for what he has said.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, why all things are lawful, saying, <b><i>meat for the belly</i></b>, in order, namely, that after the stomach has done its work, it may nourish the entire body; <b><i>and the belly for the meats</i></b>, i.e., it serves to receive food and work on it. Therefore, since by God’s ordinance the stomach is desirous of receiving food, and food was made to be put in the stomach: <i>behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food</i> (Gen 1:29), it is not unlawful for a man to get property back, or a preacher to get wages for necessary food, or even that a man eat all foods without distinction.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph296"></span>
    <b>296.</b> Second, when he says, <b><i>but God shall destroy both</i></b>, he gives the reason why all things are not expedient. For it is not expedient that a person suffer a loss in that which is never corrupted, namely, the heavenly kingdom, for the sake of something corrupted; and this happens in regard to food and stomach. After this life the use of good and of the stomach will cease, because the bodies of those who rise will be conserved without food by God’s power. And that is what he says: <b><i>but God shall destroy</i></b>, i.e., will make cease <b><i>both it</i></b>, namely, the stomach, not as to its essence but as to its effect which it has now, <b><i>and them</i></b>, namely, foods, so far as they pertain to man’s use, because in the resurrection men will be as the angels in heaven (Matt 22:30).
