  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>15:1</sup> Now, we who are stronger ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves.<br><sup>15:2</sup> Let every one of you please his neighbor unto good, unto edification.<br><sup>15:3</sup> For Christ did not please himself: but, as it is written: <i>the reproaches of those who reproached you fell upon me</i>.<br><sup>15:4</sup> For whatever things were written were written for our learning: that, through patience and the comfort of the Scriptures, we might have hope.<br><sup>15:5</sup> Now may the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind, one towards another, according to Jesus Christ:<br><sup>15:6</sup> That with one mind and with one mouth you may glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><sup>15:7</sup> Wherefore, receive one another, as Christ also has received you, unto the honor of God.<br><sup>15:8</sup> For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:<br><sup>15:9</sup> But that the gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: <i>therefore will I confess to you, O Lord, among the gentiles and will sing to your name</i>.<br><sup>15:10</sup> And again he says: <i>rejoice you gentiles, with his people</i>.<br><sup>15:11</sup> And again: <i>praise the Lord, all you gentiles: and magnify him, all you people</i>.<br><sup>15:12</sup> And again, Isaiah says: <i>there shall be a root of Jesse; and he who shall rise up to rule the gentiles, in him the gentiles shall hope</i>.<br><sup>15:13</sup> Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing: that you may abound in hope and in the power of the Holy Spirit.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>15:14</sup> And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you that you also are full of love, replenished with all knowledge, so that you are able to admonish one another.<br><sup>15:15</sup> But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were putting you in mind, because of the grace<br>which was given me by God,<br><sup>15:16</sup> That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the gentiles: sanctifying the Gospel of God, that the oblation of the gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy Spirit.<br><sup>15:17</sup> I have, therefore, glory in Christ Jesus towards God.<br><sup>15:18</sup> For I dare not speak of any of those things which Christ does not work by me, for the obedience of the gentiles, by word and deed,<br><sup>15:19</sup> By the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit, so that from Jerusalem through the circumference, as far as unto Illyricum, I have replenished the Gospel of Christ.<br><sup>15:20</sup> And I have so preached this Gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man a foundation.<br><sup>15:21</sup> But as it is written: <i>they to whom he was not spoken of shall see: and they who have not heard shall understand</i>.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>15:22</sup> For which cause also I was hindered very much from coming to you and have been prevented until now.<br><sup>15:23</sup> But now, having no more place in these countries and having a great desire these many years past to come unto you,<br><sup>15:24</sup> When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain, I hope that, as I pass, I shall see you and be brought on my way thither by you: if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you.<br><sup>15:25</sup> But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister to the saints.<br><sup>15:26</sup> For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.<br><sup>15:27</sup> For it has pleased them: and they are their debtors. For, if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.<br><sup>15:28</sup> When therefore I shall have accomplished this and consigned to them this fruit, I shall come by you into Spain.<br><sup>15:29</sup> But I know that when I come to you I shall come in the abundance of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ.<br><sup>15:30</sup> I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the charity of the Holy Spirit, that you help me in your prayers for me to God,<br><sup>15:31</sup> That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in Judea and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in Jerusalem to the saints.<br><sup>15:32</sup> That I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you.<br><sup>15:33</sup> Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</a>
