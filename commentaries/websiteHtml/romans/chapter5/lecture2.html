    <b>394.</b> After disclosing that hope is firm, because it is a gift of the Holy Spirit, the Apostle now traces its firmness to the death of Christ.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he asks a question;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, a difficulty arises in answering it, at <b><i>for scarce for a just man</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, he answers the question, at <b><i>but God commends his charity</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph395"></span>
    <b>395.</b> First, therefore, he says: it has been stated that hope does not disappoint. This is obvious to anyone who wonders, <b><i>why did Christ, when as yet we were weak</i></b>, that is, languishing in sin: <i>be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am languishing</i> (Ps 6:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    For just as the due harmony of the humors is destroyed by bodily sickness, so by sin the correct order of our affections is removed. Therefore, when we were yet helpless, <b><i>Christ . . . died for the ungodly</i></b>: <i>Christ died for sins once for all, the just for the unrighteous</i> (1 Pet 3:18).
    <br />
    <br />
    And this <b><i>according to the time</i></b>, i.e., he was to remain dead for a definite time and then rise on the third day: <i>for as Jonah was three days in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth</i> (Matt 12:40).
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, this is marvelous, if we consider who died; also if we consider for whom he died. But it could not have been so marvelous, if no fruit were to be obtained: <i>what profit is there in my death, if I go down to the pit?</i> (Ps 30:8). None, if the salvation of the human race does not follow.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph396"></span>
    <b>396.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>for scarce</i></b>, he shows a difficulty on the part of those for whom Christ died, i.e., the ungodly, saying, <b><i>for scarce . . . will one</i></b>, that is, anyone<b><i>, die for</i></b> the release of <b><i>a just man</i></b>; rather, <i>the just man perishes and no one lays it to heart</i> (Isa 57:1). That is why I say that <b><i>scarce . . . will one die, yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die</i></b>, on account of his zeal for virtue.
    <br />
    <br />
    It is rare, because it is so great; for <i>no man has greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends</i> (John 15:13). Yet what Christ did is never done, namely, to die for the ungodly and the unjust. That is why there is reason to wonder why Christ did this.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph397"></span>
    <b>397.</b> This passage can be interpreted in another way, so that a just man will be one trained in virtue, and a good man one who is innocent. And although according to this the just man would be more excellent than the good man, yet scarcely anyone dies for the just man. The reason is that an innocent person, who is understood as good, seems more worthy of pity on account of his lack of years or of some such thing. But the just person, because he is perfect, lacks any defect that would elicit pity. Therefore, should anyone die for an innocent person, it could be through pity; but to die for a just man requires zeal for virtue, which is found in fewer persons than the emotion of pity.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph398"></span>
    <b>398.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>but God commends</i></b>, he responds to the foregoing question.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he sets out his response;
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, he argues from this to what he intends, at <b><i>much more</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    Third, he shows how this follows of necessity, at <b><i>for if, when we were enemies</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph399"></span>
    <b>399.</b> He says therefore first: it was asked why Christ died for the ungodly, and the response to this is that, through this, <b><i>God commends his charity towards us</i></b>, i.e., through this he shows that he loves us to the greatest degree, <b><i>because</i></b> if <b><i>when as yet we were sinners . . . Christ died for us</i></b>, and this <b><i>according to the time</i></b>, as was explained above.
    <br />
    <br />
    The very death of Christ shows Godâ€™s love for us, because he gave his own son that he should die in making satisfaction for us: <i>for God so loved the world that he gave his only Son</i> (John 3:16). And so as the love of God the Father for us is shown by the fact that he gives his own Spirit to us, as was said above, so also it is shown by the fact that he gave his Son, as is said here.
    <br />
    <br />
    But by the fact that he says, <b><i>commends</i></b>, he indicates a certain immensity of the divine love, which is shown both by his own deed, because he gave his Son, and by our condition, because he was not moved to do this by our merits, since we were still sinners: <i>God who is rich in mercy, on account of the exceedingly great love wherewith he has loved us, while we were still dead in sins, has raised us to life with Christ</i> (Eph 2:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph400"></span>
    <b>400.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>much more, therefore</i></b>, he concludes what he had intended from the foregoing, saying: if Christ died for us while we were still sinners, <b><i>much more being now justified by his blood</i></b>, as was said above, <b><i>whom God has proposed to be a propitiation through faith</i></b> (Rom 3:25), through his blood, <b><i>shall we be saved from wrath</i></b>, i.e., from the vengeance of eternal condemnation, which men incur by their sins: <i>brood of vipers, who showed you to flee from the wrath to come?</i> (Matt 3:7).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph401"></span>
    <b>401.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>for if, when we were enemies</i></b>, he shows the necessity of his conclusion, which proceeds by arguing from the lesser to the greater.
    <br />
    <br />
    And one should observe here two comparisons of lesser to greater, one on our part and one on the part of Christ. On our part he compares enemies to those who are reconciled. For it seems a lesser thing that someone should treat enemies well who are already reconciled. On the part of Christ he compares death to life. For his life is more powerful than his death because, as is said the last chapter of 2 Corinthians: <i>he died through weakness</i>, namely the weakness of our flesh, <i>but lives through the power of God</i> (2 Cor 13:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    And this is why he says: with reason I concluded that <b><i>much more</i></b>, being enlivened, <b><i>shall we be saved</i></b> through him. <b><i>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God</i></b>, and this <b><i>by the death of his Son</i></b>: <b><i>much more</i></b> now that we are <b><i>reconciled, shall we be saved</i></b>, and this <b><i>by his life</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph402"></span>
    <b>402.</b> Now one should note that a man is said to be an enemy of God in two ways. In one way, because he practices hostility towards God when he resists his commands: <i>he has run against him with his neck raised up</i> (Job 15:26).
    <br />
    <br />
    In another way, a man is said to be an enemy of God by the fact that God hates men, not indeed insofar as he made them, because in this regard it is said, <i>you have loved all things, and you have hated nothing of the things you have made</i> (Wis 11:25); but insofar as the enemy of man, i.e., the devil, has worked in man: i.e., as regards sin: <i>similarly God hates the ungodly</i> (Wis 14:9), and <i>the Most High hates sinners</i> (Sir 12:7).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph403"></span>
    <b>403.</b> Once the cause of enmity, namely, sin, has been removed by Christ, reconciliation through him follows: <i>God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself</i> (2 Cor 5:19); for our sin was removed through the death of his Son.
    <br />
    <br />
    In this regard it should be noted that Christâ€™s death can be considered in three ways.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, precisely as a death; and so it is said: <i>God did not make death</i> (Wis 1:13) in human nature, but it was brought on by sin. Accordingly, Christâ€™s death, precisely as death, was not so acceptable to God as to be reconciled through it, because <i>God does not delight in the death of the living</i> (Wis 1:13).
    <br />
    <br />
    In another way Christâ€™s death can be considered with emphasis on the action of the killers, which greatly displeased God. Hence St. Peter says against them: <i>you denied the holy and just one . . . and killed the author of life</i> (Acts 3:14). From this aspect Christâ€™s death could not be the cause of reconciliation but rather of indignation.
    <br />
    <br />
    It can be considered in a third way according as it proceeds from the will of Christ suffering, which was a will formed to the endurance of death, in obedience to the Father: <i>he became obedient</i> to the Father <i>even unto death</i> (Phil 2:8) and out of love for men: <i>Christ loved us and gave himself up for us</i> (Eph 5:2). From this aspect Christâ€™s death was meritorious and satisfied for our sins; it was accepted by God as sufficient for reconciling all men, even those who killed Christ, some of whom were saved at his prayer: <i>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do</i> (Luke 23:34).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph404"></span>
    <b>404.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>not only so</i></b>, he shows what benefits we obtain even now through grace, saying, <b><i>not only so</i></b>, i.e., not only in the hope of the glory we expect in the future, <b><i>but also we glory in God</i></b>, i.e., in being even now united to God by faith and charity: <i>let him who boasts, boast in the Lord</i> (1 Cor 1:31 and 2 Cor 10:17). And this <b><i>through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have</i></b> even <b><i>now</i></b> during this life <b><i>received reconciliation</i></b>, so that we have been changed from enemies to friends: <i>through him he reconciled to himself all things</i> (Col 1:20).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph405"></span>
    <b>405.</b> The verse, <b><i>not only so</i></b>, can be connected with the preceding one, so that the sense would be: <b><i>we shall be saved by his life</i></b> from sin and punishment; and not only shall we be saved from evils, but shall rejoice in God, i.e., in the fact that we shall be the same in the future with him: <i>that they may be one in us, even as we are one</i> (John 17:22).
