  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>5:1</sup> Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:<br><sup>5:2</sup> By whom also we have access through faith into this grace wherein we stand: and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.<br><sup>5:3</sup> And not only so: but we glory also in tribulation, knowing that tribulation works patience;<br><sup>5:4</sup> And patience trial; and trial hope;<br><sup>5:5</sup> And hope does not confound: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Spirit who is given to us.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>5:6</sup> For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?<br><sup>5:7</sup> For scarce for a just man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die.<br><sup>5:8</sup> But God commends his charity towards us: because when as yet we were sinners according to the time, Christ died for us.<br><sup>5:9</sup> Much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.<br><sup>5:10</sup> For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.<br><sup>5:11</sup> And not only so: but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>5:12</sup> Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture4.html"><sup>5:13</sup> For until the law sin was in the world: but sin was not imputed, when the law was not.<br><sup>5:14</sup> But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who have not sinned, after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture5.html"><sup>5:15</sup> But not as the offense, so also the gift. For if by the offense of one, many died: much more the grace of God and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded unto many.<br><sup>5:16</sup> And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation: but grace is of many offences unto justification.<br><sup>5:17</sup> For if by one manâ€™s offense death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift and of justice shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.<br><sup>5:18</sup> Therefore, as by the offense of one, unto all men to condemnation: so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.<br><sup>5:19</sup> For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners: so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture6.html"><sup>5:20</sup> Now the law entered in that sin might abound.<br>And where sin abounded, grace did more abound.<br><sup>5:21</sup> That as sin has reigned to death: so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</a>
