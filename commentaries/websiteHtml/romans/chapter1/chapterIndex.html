  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>1:1</sup> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the Gospel of God.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>1:2</sup> Which he had promised before, through his prophets, in the holy Scriptures,<br><sup>1:3</sup> Concerning his Son, who was made to him of the seed of David, according to the flesh,</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>1:4</sup> Who was predestined the Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead:</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture4.html"><sup>1:5</sup> Through whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith, in all nations, for his name:<br><sup>1:6</sup> Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:<br><sup>1:7</sup> To all who are at Rome, the beloved of God, called to be saints. Grace to you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture5.html"><sup>1:8</sup> First, I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for you all: because your faith is proclaimed in the whole world.<br><sup>1:9</sup> For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make a commemoration of you:<br><sup>1:10</sup> Always in my prayers making request, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you.<br><sup>1:11</sup> For I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace, to strengthen you:<br><sup>1:12</sup> That is to say, that I may be comforted together in you by that which is common to us both, your faith and mine.<br><sup>1:13</sup> And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come unto you (and have been hindered hitherto) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other gentiles.<br><sup>1:14</sup> To the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise, I am a debtor.<br><sup>1:15</sup> So (as much as is in me) I am ready to preach the Gospel to you also who are at Rome.<br><sup>1:16</sup> For I am not ashamed of the Gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes: to the Jew first and to the Greek.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture6.html"><sup>1:16</sup> For I am not ashamed of the Gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes: to the Jew first and to the Greek.<br><sup>1:17</sup> For the justice of God is revealed therein, from faith unto faith, as it is written: <i>the just man lives by faith</i>.<br><sup>1:18</sup> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of those men who detain the truth of God in injustice:<br><sup>1:19</sup> Because that which is known of God is manifest in them. For God has manifested it unto them.<br><sup>1:20</sup> For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; his eternal power also and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture7.html"><sup>1:20</sup> For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made. His eternal power also and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.<br><sup>1:21</sup> Because that, when they knew God, they had not glorified him as God or given thanks, but became vain in their thoughts. And their foolish heart was darkened.<br><sup>1:22</sup> For, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.<br><sup>1:23</sup> And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of a corruptible man and of birds, and of fourfooted beasts and of creeping things.<br><sup>1:24</sup> Wherefore, God gave them up to the desires of their heart, unto uncleanness: to dishonour their own bodies among themselves,<br><sup>1:25</sup> Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture8.html"><sup>1:26</sup> For this cause, God delivered them up to shameful affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature.<br><sup>1:27</sup> And, in like manner, the men also, leaving the natural use of the women, have burned in their lusts, one towards another: men with men, working that which is filthy and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error.<br><sup>1:28</sup> And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge, God delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not fitting.<br><sup>1:29</sup> Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness: full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity: whisperers,<br><sup>1:30</sup> Detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,<br><sup>1:31</sup> Foolish, dissolute: without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.<br><sup>1:32</sup> Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand that they who do such things, are worthy of death: and not only they who do them, but they also who consent to those who do them.</a>
