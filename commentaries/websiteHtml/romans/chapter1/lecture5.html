    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph74"></span>
    <b>74.</b> After the greeting, the Apostle begins the message, wherein
    <br />
    <br />
    first he shows his affection for his readers, in order to render them benevolent hearers;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he instructs them in the truth about the power of Christ’s grace, at <b><i>for it is the power of God</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    He shows his affection for them in three ways:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, by giving thanks for their blessings;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, by the prayer he directs to God on their behalf, at <b><i>for God is my witness</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, by his desire to visit them, at <b><i>always in my prayers</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph75"></span>
    <b>75.</b> In regard to the first, three things should be noted.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, the order in which he gives thanks, when he says <b><i>first, I give thanks to my God</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    For it is necessary that in all affairs, we begin by giving thanks: <i>give thanks in all circumstances</i> (1 Thess 5:18); indeed, a person is not worthy to receive a blessing, if he does not express thanks for past blessings: <i>the hope of an ungrateful man will melt like wintry frost</i> (Wis 16:29) and <i>to the place where the streams flow, there they return</i> (Eccl 1:7), because to the source whence blessings come they return, namely, by giving thanks, to flow again by repeated blessings.
    <br />
    <br />
    But we need God’s blessing in all we seek or do; consequently, before all else thanks should be given.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph76"></span>
    <b>76.</b> Second, he designates three persons, one of whom is the person to whom thanksgiving is made when he says <b><i>my God</i></b> to whom thanks are due for all our blessings, because they flow from him: <i>every good endowment and every perfect gift is from above</i> (Jas 1:17). And although he is God of all through creation and governance, as is said below: <b><i>Lord of all</i></b> (Rom 10:12), he is particularly the God of the just for three reasons: first, on account of the special care he shows them: <i>the eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous</i> (Ps 34:15) and again: <i>the Lord is my light</i> (Ps 27:1); on account of their special worship: <i>this is my God and I will praise him</i> (Exod 15:2); third, because he is their reward: <i>I am your reward exceedingly great</i> (Gen 15:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    The second person is the mediator, whom he mentions when he says <b><i>through Jesus Christ</i></b>. For thanks should be returned to God in the same order in which graces come to us, namely, through Jesus Christ: <b><i>through him we have access to this grace in which we stand</i></b> (Rom 5:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    The third is the person of those for whom he gives thanks, for all of you, because he regarded their graces as his on account of the bond of love. As if to say: <i>I have no greater grace than to hear that my children walk in the truth</i> (3 John 1:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    He purposely says <b><i>for all of you</i></b> because he desires to please them all: <i>just as I try to please all men in everything I do</i> (1 Cor 10:33) and wishes the salvation of all: <i>I wish that all were as I myself am</i> (1 Cor 7:7).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph77"></span>
    <b>77.</b> Third, he indicates the point about which he is grateful, <b><i>because your faith is proclaimed in the whole world</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    He gives thanks for their faith, because it is the foundation of all spiritual blessings: <i>faith is the substance of things hoped for</i> (Heb 11:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    But the reason he commends the Romans on their faith is that they embraced it with ease and continued in it firmly. Hence, even today very many signs of faith are seen by those who visit the holy places, as Jerome says in <i>On the Epistle to the Galatians</i>. However, their faith was not yet perfect, because some of them had been reached by false apostles, who taught that the rites of the law must be joined to the Gospel.
    <br />
    <br />
    But he rejoices and gives thanks for their faith not only on their account but on account of the benefits accruing therefrom, namely because, being the rulers of the world, their example would lead other nations to accept the faith; for, as a Gloss says, the lesser are quick to do what they see done by the greater. On this account prelates are advised to be <i>good examples to the flock</i> (1 Pet 5:3).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph78"></span>
    <b>78.</b> Then when he says <b><i>for God is my witness</i></b>, he shows his affection for them from the prayer he offers for them.
    <br />
    <br />
    And because the business of prayer is carried on in secret in God’s presence: <i>when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father in secret</i> (Matt 6:6), he calls on God to testify that he prays for them.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, therefore, he calls on the witness; second he shows on what point he calls the witness.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph79"></span>
    <b>79.</b> He calls on the witness when he says <b><i>God is my witness</i></b> under whose witness all things are done: <i>I am judge and witness</i> (Jer 29:23).
    <br />
    <br />
    Then, to show that he is not mistaken in calling on the just witness, he mentions how he is joined to him. First, in regard to service when he says <b><i>whom I serve</i></b>, namely, with the worship of latria: <i>the Lord your God shall you adore and him alone shall you serve</i> (Deut 6:13). Second, in regard to the way he served when he says, <b><i>in my spirit</i></b>. As if to say: not only in outward bodily service, but especially within, according to the spirit: <i>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth</i> (John 4:24). Or <b><i>in spirit</i></b>, i.e., in spiritual observances, not in carnal, as the Jews: <i>we are the true circumcision who worship God in spirit</i> (Phil 3:3). Third, in regard to the office in which he serves, namely, <b><i>in the Gospel of his Son</i></b>: <b><i>separated unto the Gospel</i></b> (Rom 1:1). It is the Gospel of the Son in three ways: first, because it is about him: <i>I bring you good news of a great joy</i> (Luke 2:10). Second, because it was preached by him as a special duty: <i>I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose</i> (Luke 4:43). Third, because it was enjoined by him: <i>preach the Gospel to every creature</i> (Mark 16:15).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph80"></span>
    <b>80.</b> But since, as Augustine says, it is the same to say <b><i>for God is my witness</i></b> and <i>I swear by God</i>, the Apostle seems to be acting against the Lord’s command: <i>I say to you, do not swear at all</i> (Matt 5:34); <i>above all, my brethren, do not swear</i> (Jas 5:12).
    <br />
    <br />
    However, as Augustine also says, the meaning of Sacred Scripture is gathered from the actions of the saints. For it is the same Spirit who inspired the Sacred Scriptures: <i>men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God</i> (2 Pet 1:21) and who moves holy men to act: <b><i>all who are led by the Spirit are sons of God</i></b> (Rom 8:14).
    <br />
    <br />
    Consequently, if Paul is found to swear, it shows that the Lord’s word and that of the apostle James are not to be understood as indicating that an oath is absolutely unlawful, but that men should strive as far as possible not to use oaths as though they were something good and desirable of their very nature. And this on account of the danger involved in frequent swearing, namely, the possibility of perjury due to a slip of the tongue. Ecclesiastes says, <i>do not accustom your mouth to oaths for many are tripped by them</i> (Sir 23:9). Also because it seems contrary to the reverence we owe God for one to call God as witness without necessity. Hence: <i>let not the naming of God be usual in your mouth</i> (Sir 23:10). For this reason the Apostle never made an oath except in writing, when a man speaks with greater deliberation and caution.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph81"></span>
    <b>81.</b> Yet an oath is sometimes necessary to lend credence to a speaker, which in turn often benefits the hearer. Consequently, the Apostle makes an oath for the benefit of his hearer, for whom it was beneficial to believe, as though not seeking what was useful to himself but to the majority, namely, their salvation.
    <br />
    <br />
    Hence, the Lord’s statement that <i>anything more than this</i>, i.e., than a simple word, <i>comes from evil</i> (Matt 5:37) does not imply that it comes from evil in the one who swears, but in the one who demands the oath: it comes not from the evil of sin, except in the case where a person judges that the one from whom he demands the oath will swear falsely—in which case it is a serious sin, as Augustine says. Rather, it implies that it comes from the evil of punishment, i.e., our ignorance of whether something said to us is true.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph82"></span>
    <b>82.</b> It should be noted that there are two ways of making an oath: one is by a simple statement, as when it is said <i>by God</i> or <b><i>God is my witness</i></b>. This is the form the Apostle uses here. The other is by an imprecation, namely, when a person calls on God’s witness in the form of some punishment to be inflicted on the speaker if he is lying: <i>if I have requited evil with evil</i> (Ps 7:3ff.). The Apostle also uses this form, as in 2 Corinthians: <i>I call God to witness against my life</i> (2 Cor 1:23).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph83"></span>
    <b>83.</b> Then he mentions the matter concerning which he calls God to witness when he says, <b><i>that without ceasing I make a commemoration of you</i></b>, i.e., because in his prayers he always prayed for them on account of the general benefits that arose from their conversion: <i>far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you</i> (1 Sam 12:23).
    <br />
    <br />
    The statement <b><i>I make a commemoration of you</i></b> can be understood in two ways: in one way according to the sense of a psalm: <i>let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you</i> (Ps 137:6); in another way <b><i>I make a commemoration of you</i></b>, i.e., I pray to God, who receives the prayers of the humble. Therefore, when the saints pray for certain people, they are somehow presented to his gaze, just as their other actions are. Hence, the woman said to Elijah: <i>you have come to bring my sin to remembrance</i> (1 Kgs 17:18), as though whatever is done against the just is in the memory and eyes of God.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph84"></span>
    <b>84.</b> That he claims to pray <b><i>without ceasing</i></b> is in agreement with what he tells the Thessalonians: <i>pray constantly</i> (1 Thess 5:7) and with Luke: <i>they ought always to pray and not lose heart</i> (Luke 18:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    This can be understood in three ways: in one way, as to the very act of praying, and then one is praying always or without ceasing, if he prays at the appointed times and hours: <i>Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour</i> (Acts 3:1). In another way, as to the purpose of prayer which is that our mind rise up to God; and so a man prays as long as he directs his entire life to God: <i>whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God</i> (1 Cor 10:31). Third, as to the cause; for when a person so acts that others pray for him, he seems to be praying, as in the case of those who give alms to the poor who pray for them: <i>store up almsgiving in the heart of the poor</i> (Eccl 29:12).
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, <b><i>I give thanks to my God for you</i></b> because I regard your blessings as my own. This is obvious from the fact that I pray for you as I do for myself.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph85"></span>
    <b>85.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>making request</i></b>, he proves his affection by his desire to visit them.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he mentions the desire;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, his intention of acting on this desire, at <b><i>and I would not have you ignorant</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he mentions a sign of this desire;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, the cause of his desire, at <b><i>for I long</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph86"></span>
    <b>86.</b> The sign of the desire is the prayer he said for them, which implies such a desire.
    <br />
    <br />
    That the desire itself was intense is shown when he says <b><i>making request</i></b> for something very important which is beyond my merits: <i>the poor use entreaties, but the rich answer roughly</i> (Prov 18:23); for something intensely desired seems great to the one desiring.
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, it is an anxious desire, for he says <b><i>if by any means</i></b>. For if a person anxiously desires something, he seeks to get it by any means, easy or difficult: <i>what then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I shall rejoice</i> (Phil 1:18–19).
    <br />
    <br />
    Third, the desire was of long standing, for he says <b><i>now at length</i></b>, i.e., after long desiring it. For the just are concerned not for a short time but continuously: <i>a friend loves at all times</i> (Prov 17:17).
    <br />
    <br />
    Fourth, the desire was correct, because it was in keeping with God’s will. Hence he adds <b><i>if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey</i></b>, i.e., in keeping with his will, in terms of which I judge success: <i>not as I will, but as you will</i> (Matt 26:39).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph87"></span>
    <b>87.</b> Then when he says <b><i>for I long to see you</i></b>, he mentions the causes of the desire, and there are two.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, the welfare of those he would visit; hence, <b><i>I long to see you</i></b>: <i>I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus</i> (Phil 1:8), not for a trifling reason as in worldly friendship, but <b><i>that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace</i></b>, not as its author but as its minister: <i>one should regard us as stewards of the mysteries of God</i> (1 Cor 4:1); and this <b><i>to strengthen you</i></b> in the faith you have received: <i>when you have been converted, strengthen your brethren</i> (Luke 22:32).
    <br />
    <br />
    Now a minister imparts grace in a number of ways, one of which is by the administration of the sacraments of grace: <i>as each has received a gift, administer it to one another as good dispensers of God’s grace</i> (1 Pet 4:10) and by exhorting in sermons: <i>let no evil talk come out of your mouth, but only such as is good for edifying . . . that it may impart grace to those who hear</i> (Eph 4:29).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph88"></span>
    <b>88.</b> The second cause is the mutual consolation found in friendly communication. Hence he continues <b><i>that I may be comforted together in you</i></b>, i.e., me by seeing you and imparting a grace, and all of us <b><i>by that which is common to us both, your faith and mine</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    For it is a source of mutual consolation to be one in the faith: <i>but God who comforts the downcast comforted us by the coming of Titus: not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you</i> (2 Cor 6:6).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph89"></span>
    <b>89.</b> Then when he says <b><i>I would not have you ignorant</i></b>, he mentions his intention to fulfill his plan lest it appear to be a vain desire.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he mentions his plan;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, its cause, at <b><i>that I might have some fruit</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, his eagerness, at <b><i>so, as much as is in me</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he mentions his plan;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, the obstacle, at <b><i>and have been hindered hitherto</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph90"></span>
    <b>90.</b> He says, therefore, first: not only do I desire to see you, but I have decided to fulfill this desire, <b><i>and I want you to know, brethren, that I have often intended to come to you</i></b> to prove my love <i>not only in word or speech but in deed and in truth</i> (1 John 3:18).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph91"></span>
    <b>91.</b> Second, he touches on the obstacle preventing him from having fulfilled that intention, saying, <b><i>and have been hindered hitherto</i></b> either by the devil, who endeavors to prevent the preaching from which man’s salvation results: <i>the north wind drives away rain</i> (Prov 25:23), i.e., the doctrines of the preachers; or perhaps by God, according to whose nod the journeys and words of preachers are arranged: <i>the clouds</i>, i.e., preachers, <i>scatter his lightning. They turn round and round by his guidance to accomplish all that he commands them</i> (Job 37:11ff.). Hence in Acts it is recorded: <i>they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia</i> (Acts 16:6); and again: <i>they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them</i>.
    <br />
    <br />
    But the Apostle wants them to know both these things for their own benefit, so that seeing his affection, they might receive his words with more reverence, and recognizing their own conduct as the obstacle hitherto preventing his visit, they might amend their lives. So the words of Isaiah express a punishment for sin: <i>I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it</i> (Isa 5:6).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph92"></span>
    <b>92.</b> Then he gives two reasons for his intention. The first is utility; hence he says <b><i>that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace, to strengthen you</i></b> to whom I have preached.
    <br />
    <br />
    This can be taken in two ways: in one way as though he were saying: that I may reap some harvest among you by my preaching: <i>you should go and bear fruit</i> (John 15:16). In another way as though from their conversion a harvest would grow for him: <i>he who reaps, receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life</i> (John 4:36).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph93"></span>
    <b>93.</b> The other reason is the responsibility of his office: <i>woe to me, if I do not preach the Gospel</i> (1 Cor 9:16).
    <br />
    <br />
    And because he had undertaken the general apostolate of the gentiles, he asserts that he is under obligation to all: <i>although I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all</i> (1 Cor 9:19).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph94"></span>
    <b>94.</b> And for this reason he sets out two diversities. One is along the lines of the diversity of nations, when he says, <b><i>to Greeks and to barbarians</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    A person is called a barbarian, either because he is cut off from some people in one way or another in the sense of 1 Corinthians: <i>if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a barbarian to the speaker and the speaker to me</i> (1 Cor 13:11); or because he is cut off from the human race, inasmuch as he is not ruled by reason. Hence, they are properly called barbarians who are not directed by reason. This is implied in 2 Maccabees: <i>do not act so fiercely and barbarously</i> (2 Macc 15:2), i.e., inhumanly.
    <br />
    <br />
    Now because the Greeks were the first to establish laws, he calls all the gentiles ruled by human laws Greeks.
    <br />
    <br />
    He makes no mention of the Jews who were ruled by divine laws, because he was not appointed apostle to the Jews but to the gentiles: <i>we to the gentiles and they to the circumcised</i> (Gal 2:9).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph95"></span>
    <b>95.</b> Both reasons account for his readiness of will, so that he says <b><i>so (as much as is in me)</i></b>, i.e., as far as I am concerned, <b><i>I am ready</i></b>, unless prevented, <b><i>to preach the Gospel to you also who are at Rome</i></b>: <i>then all the people departed from the presence of Moses. And they came everyone whose heart stirred him</i> (Exod 35:20).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph96"></span>
    <b>96.</b> He rejects the obstacle to eagerness, namely shame, on account of which many fail to do what they would otherwise do readily; hence he says, <b><i>I am not ashamed of the Gospel</i></b>, which, indeed, seemed to be an occasion of shame for some in the presence of unbelievers, as he states in 1 Corinthians: <i>we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and folly to the gentiles</i> (1 Cor 1:23). But there is really no reason for shame, because he continues: <i>but unto them who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God</i>. Hence it is said: <i>whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him the Son of man will be ashamed</i> (Luke 9:26).
    <br />
    <br />
    That is why the baptized are anointed with the chrism in the form of a cross on the forehead, where shame has its seat, namely, lest they be ashamed of the Gospel.
