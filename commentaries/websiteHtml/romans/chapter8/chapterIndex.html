  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>8:1</sup> There is now therefore no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh.<br><sup>8:2</sup> For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, has delivered me from the law of sin and of death.<br><sup>8:3</sup> For what was impossible for the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, has condemned sin in the flesh.<br><sup>8:4</sup> That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us<br>who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.<br><sup>8:5</sup> For they who are according to the flesh mind the things that are of the flesh: but they who are according to the spirit mind the things that are of the spirit.<br><sup>8:6</sup> For the prudence of the flesh is death: but the prudence of the spirit is life and peace.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>8:7</sup> Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God. For it is not subject to the law of God: nor can it be.<br><sup>8:8</sup> And they who are in the flesh cannot please God.<br><sup>8:9</sup> But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any man has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.<br><sup>8:10</sup> But if Christ is in you, the body indeed is dead, because of sin: but the spirit lives, because of justification.<br><sup>8:11</sup> And if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead shall enliven also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit dwelling in you.<br><sup>8:12</sup> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.<br><sup>8:13</sup> For if you live according to the flesh, you will die: but if by the spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you will live.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>8:14</sup> For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.<br><sup>8:15</sup> For you have not received the spirit of slavery again in fear: but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, in whom we cry: Abba, Father.<br><sup>8:16</sup> For the Spirit himself gives testimony to our spirit that we are the sons of God.<br><sup>8:17</sup> And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God and joint heirs with Christ:<br>yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture4.html"><sup>8:18</sup> For I consider that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that will be revealed in us.<br><sup>8:19</sup> For the expectation of the creature waits for the revelation of the sons of God.<br><sup>8:20</sup> For the creature was subjected to vanity: not willingly, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope.<br><sup>8:21</sup> Because the creature also itself will be delivered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God.<br><sup>8:22</sup> For we know that every creature groans and travails in pain, even till now.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture5.html"><sup>8:23</sup> And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the spirit: even we ourselves groan inwardly, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.<br><sup>8:24</sup> For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope. For who sees that which he hopes for?<br><sup>8:25</sup> But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.<br><sup>8:26</sup> Likewise, the Spirit also helps our infirmity. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit himself asks for us with unspeakable groanings, [n. 686.]<br><sup>8:27</sup> And he who searches the hearts knows what the Spirit desires: because he asks for the saints according to God.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture6.html"><sup>8:28</sup> And we know that to those who love God all things work together unto good: to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be saints.<br><sup>8:29</sup> For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be made conformed to the image of his Son: that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.<br><sup>8:30</sup> And whom he predestined, them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified.<br><sup>8:31</sup> What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?<br><sup>8:32</sup> He who did not even spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how has he not also, with him, given us all things?</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture7.html"><sup>8:33</sup> Who will accuse against the elect of God? God is he who justifies:<br><sup>8:34</sup> Who is he who will condemn?<br>Christ Jesus who died: yea, who is risen also again, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.<br><sup>8:35</sup> Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? Or distress? Or famine? Or nakedness? Or danger? Or persecution? Or the sword?<br><sup>8:36</sup> (As it is written: <i>for your sake, we are put to death all the day long. We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered</i>.)<br><sup>8:37</sup> But in all these things we overcome, because of him who has loved us.<br><sup>8:38</sup> For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor might,<br><sup>8:39</sup> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</a>
