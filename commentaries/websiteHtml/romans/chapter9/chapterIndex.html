  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>9:1</sup> I speak the truth in Christ: I am not lying, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit:<br><sup>9:2</sup> That I have great sadness and continual sorrow in my heart.<br><sup>9:3</sup> For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my brethren, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh,<br><sup>9:4</sup> Who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption of sons and the glory and the testament and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises,<br><sup>9:5</sup> To them belong the patriarchs, and of their race is Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed forever. Amen.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>9:6</sup> Not as though the word of God has failed. For all are not Israelites that are of Israel.<br><sup>9:7</sup> Neither are all they who are the seed of Abraham, sons: but <i>in Isaac will your seed be called</i>.<br><sup>9:8</sup> That is to say, not they who are the sons of the flesh are the children of God: but they who are the sons of the promise are accounted for the seed.<br><sup>9:9</sup> For this is the word of promise: <i>according to this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son</i>.<br><sup>9:10</sup> And not only she, but Rebecca also had conceived at once from Isaac our father.<br><sup>9:11</sup> For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or evil (that the purpose of God according to election might stand),<br><sup>9:12</sup> Not of works, but of him who calls, it was said to her: <i>the elder shall serve the younger</i>.<br><sup>9:13</sup> As it is written: <i>Jacob I have loved: but Esau I have hated</i>.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>9:14</sup> What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God?<br>God forbid!<br><sup>9:15</sup> For he says to Moses: <i>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy. And I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy</i>.<br><sup>9:16</sup> So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.<br><sup>9:17</sup> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: <i>to this purpose have I raised you, that I may show my power in you and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth</i>.<br><sup>9:18</sup> Therefore he has mercy on whom he wills. And he hardens whom he wills.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture4.html"><sup>9:19</sup> You will say therefore to me: why does he still find fault? For who resists his will?<br><sup>9:20</sup> O man, who are you who replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to him who formed it: why have you made me thus?<br><sup>9:21</sup> Or has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonour?<br><sup>9:22</sup> What if God, willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction,<br><sup>9:23</sup> That he might show the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he has prepared unto glory?</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture5.html"><sup>9:24</sup> Even us, whom he also has called, not only of the Jews but also of the gentiles.<br><sup>9:25</sup> As in Hosea he says: <i>I will call those who were not my people, my people; and her who was not beloved, beloved; and her who had not obtained mercy, one who has obtained mercy</i>.<br><sup>9:26</sup> <i>And it shall be in the place where it was said unto them: you are not my people; there they shall be called the sons of the living God</i>.<br><sup>9:27</sup> And Isaiah cried out concerning Israel: <i>if the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved</i>.<br><sup>9:28</sup> <i>For he shall finish his word and cut it short in equity: because a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth</i>.<br><sup>9:29</sup> And as Isaiah foretold: <i>unless the Lord of the Sabbath had left us a seed, we would have been made as Sodom and been made like Gomorrha</i>.<br><sup>9:30</sup> What then shall we say? That the gentiles who did not follow after justice have attained to justice, even the justice that is of faith.<br><sup>9:31</sup> But Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not come unto the law of justice.<br><sup>9:32</sup> Why so? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were of works. For they stumbled at the stumbling stone.<br><sup>9:33</sup> As it is written: <i>behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of scandal. And whosoever believes in him shall not be confounded</i>.</a>
