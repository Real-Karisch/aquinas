  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>13:1</sup> Let every soul be subject to higher powers. For there is no power except from God, and those who are ordained of God.<br><sup>13:2</sup> Therefore, he who resists the power resists the ordinance of God. And they who resist purchase to themselves damnation.<br><sup>13:3</sup> For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Do you will then to not fear power? Do what is good: and you will have praise from the same.<br><sup>13:4</sup> For he is God’s minister to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid: for he carries not the sword in vain. For he is God’s minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil.<br><sup>13:5</sup> Therefore one must be subject of necessity: not only for wrath, but also for conscience’s sake.<br><sup>13:6</sup> For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the ministers of God, serving unto this purpose.<br><sup>13:7</sup> Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honor, to whom honor.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>13:8</sup> Owe no one anything, except to love one another. For he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.<br><sup>13:9</sup> For: you shall not commit adultery: you shall not kill: you shall not steal: you shall not bear false witness: you shall not covet. And if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word: you shall love your neighbor as yourself.<br><sup>13:10</sup> The love of our neighbor works no evil. Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>13:11</sup> And knowing this time, because it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.<br><sup>13:12</sup> The night is passed, but the day is at hand.<br>Let us, therefore, cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.<br><sup>13:13</sup> Let us walk honestly, as in the day:<br>not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and envy.<br><sup>13:14</sup> But put on the Lord Jesus Christ: and make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscences.</a>
