  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>7:1</sup> Do you not know, brethren (for I speak to those who know the law) that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?<br><sup>7:2</sup> For the woman who has a husband, while her husband lives is bound to the law. But if her husband dies, she is loosed from the law of her husband.<br><sup>7:3</sup> Therefore, while her husband lives, she will be called an adulteress, if she be with another man: but if her husband dies, she is delivered from the law of her husband: so that she is not an adulteress, if she be with another man.<br><sup>7:4</sup> Therefore, my brethren, you also have died to the law, by the body of Christ: that you may belong to another, who is risen again from the dead that we may bear fruit to God.<br><sup>7:5</sup> For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, which were by the law, worked in our members, to bear fruit unto death.<br><sup>7:6</sup> But now we are loosed from the law of death in which we were detained; so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>7:7</sup> What shall we say, then? Is the law sin?<br>God forbid! But I would not have known sin, except through the law. For I would not have known concupiscence, if the law did not say: <i>you shall not covet</i>.<br><sup>7:8</sup> But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.<br>For without the law sin was dead.<br><sup>7:9</sup> And I lived some time without the law. But when the commandment came, sin revived,<br><sup>7:10</sup> And I died. And the commandment that was ordained to life, the same was found to be unto death to me.<br><sup>7:11</sup> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, seduced me: and by it killed me.<br><sup>7:12</sup> Wherefore the law indeed is holy: and the commandment holy and just and good.<br><sup>7:13</sup> Did that then which is good bring death unto me? God forbid! But sin, that it may appear sin, through good, wrought death in me: that sin, by the commandment, might become sinful above measure.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>7:14</sup> For we know that the law is spiritual. But I am carnal, sold under sin.<br><sup>7:15</sup> For that which I work, I do not understand. For I do not that good which I will: but the evil which I hate, that I do.<br><sup>7:16</sup> If then I do that which I will not, I consent to the law, that it is good.<br><sup>7:17</sup> Now then it is no more I that do it: but sin that dwells in me.<br><sup>7:18</sup> For I know that the good does not dwell in me, that is to say, in my flesh. For to will is present with me: but to accomplish good, I cannot find.<br><sup>7:19</sup> For the good which I will, I do not: but the evil which I will not, that I do.<br><sup>7:20</sup> Now if I do that which I will not, it is no more I that do it: but sin that dwells in me.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture4.html"><sup>7:21</sup> I find then a law, that when I have a will to do good, evil is present with me.<br><sup>7:22</sup> For I am delighted with the law of God, according to the inner man:<br><sup>7:23</sup> But I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind and captivating me in the law of sin that is in my members.<br><sup>7:24</sup> Unhappy man that I am, who will deliver me from the body of this death?<br><sup>7:25</sup> The grace of God, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself serve the law of God with the mind: but with the flesh, the law of sin.</a>
