  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>10:1</sup> Brethren, the will of my heart, indeed and my prayer to God is for them unto salvation.<br><sup>10:2</sup> For I bear them witness that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.<br><sup>10:3</sup> For they, being ignorant of the justice of God and seeking to establish their own, have not submitted themselves to the justice of God.<br><sup>10:4</sup> For the end of the law is Christ: unto justice to everyone who believes.<br><sup>10:5</sup> For Moses wrote that the man who practices the justice which is based on the law shall live by it.<br><sup>10:6</sup> But the justice which is of faith, speaks thus: <i>do not say</i> in your heart: <i>who will ascend into heaven?</i> that is, to bring Christ down;<br><sup>10:7</sup> Or <i>who will descend into the abyss?</i> that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.<br><sup>10:8</sup> But what says the Scripture? <i>The word is near you; even on your mouth and in your heart</i>.<br>This is the word of faith, which we preach.<br><sup>10:9</sup> For if you confess with your mouth the <i>Lord Jesus</i> and believe in your heart that God has raised him up from the dead, you shall be saved.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>10:10</sup> For, with the heart, man believes unto justice: but, with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.<br><sup>10:11</sup> For the Scripture says: whosoever <i>believes in him shall not be confounded</i>.<br><sup>10:12</sup> For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek: for the same is Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon him.<br><sup>10:13</sup> For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.<br><sup>10:14</sup> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? Or how shall they believe him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?<br><sup>10:15</sup> And how shall they preach unless they be sent?<br>As it is written: <i>how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace, of them preaching good things</i>?<br><sup>10:16</sup> But all do not obey the Gospel. For Isaiah says: <i>Lord, who has believed our report?</i><br><sup>10:17</sup> Faith therefore comes by hearing; and that which is heard, through the word of Christ.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>10:18</sup> But I say: have they not heard? Yes, verily: their sound has gone forth into all the earth: and their words unto the ends of the whole world.<br><sup>10:19</sup> But I say: has not Israel known? First, Moses says: <i>I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation: by a foolish nation I will anger you</i>.<br><sup>10:20</sup> But Isaiah is bold, and says: <i>I was found by those who did not seek me. I appeared openly to those who did not ask after me</i>.<br><sup>10:21</sup> But to Israel he says: <i>all the day long have I spread my hands to a people that does not believe and contradicts me</i>.</a>
