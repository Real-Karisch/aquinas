    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph224"></span>
    <b>224.</b> After showing that the doers of the law are justified even without being hearers, which pertained to the gentiles, the Apostle now shows that hearers are not justified, unless they are doers, which pertains to the Jews.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, therefore, he shows the Jews’ privileged state in receiving the law;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, their shortcomings in transgressing the law, at <b><i>you, therefore, who teaches another</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    He shows their privileged state on three counts:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, in being the race to whom the law was given;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, as regards the law itself, at <b><i>and rest in the law</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, as regards the effect or work of the law, at <b><i>and knows his will</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph225"></span>
    <b>225.</b> In regard to race he says, <b><i>but if you are called a Jew</i></b>, which is an honorable name: <i>Judah became his sanctuary</i> (Ps 114:2); <i>salvation is from the Jews</i> (John 14:22).
    <br />
    <br />
    They are called Jews not after Judas Maccabeus as some say, probably on the ground that he united and protected that people, when they were scattered: <i>he gladly fought for Israel</i> (1 Macc 3:2); for the name ‘Jews’ was in use before his time, as in Esther: <i>the Jews had light and gladness</i> (Esth 8:16).
    <br />
    <br />
    Rather, it seems that the Jews were named after the patriarch Judah: <i>Judah, your brothers shall praise you</i> (Gen 49:8); for in the time of Roboam, when ten tribes seceded from his kingdom and adored a golden calf, they were led away captive by the Assyrians (1 Sam 17). Scripture makes no mention of their return; rather, the land remained occupied by strangers later called Samaritans. But two tribes, Judah and Benjamin, remained in the kingdom of Roboam and persevered in the worship of God. Although they were led away captive to Babylon, they were permitted to return to their native land by Cyrus, the Persian king (1 Ezra 1). Then, because the tribe of Judah was the greater, the entire group was named after him: not only those from the tribe of Benjamin but those from the other tribes who joined them.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph226"></span>
    <b>226.</b> Then when he says <b><i>and rests in the law</i></b> he mentions their prerogative in regard to the law.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, in regard to the law itself, when he says, <b><i>and rests in the law</i></b>, as certifying what they believed and did. For an intellect in doubt is not at rest but is solicited by both sides; but once it has the certainty of wisdom it rests: <i>when I enter my house, I shall find rest with her</i> (Wis 8:16).
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, in regard to the lawgiver, when he adds <b><i>and make your boast of God</i></b>, i.e., in their worship and knowledge of one God: <i>let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows me</i> (Jer 9:24); <i>let him who boasts boast in the Lord</i> (1 Cor 1:31).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph227"></span>
    <b>227.</b> Then when he adds <b><i>and know his will</i></b>, he mentions their prerogative in regard to the fruit of the law:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, with respect to the person himself;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, with respect to others, at <b><i>are confident</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph228"></span>
    <b>228.</b> In regard to the first he mentions two fruits.
    <br />
    <br />
    The first corresponds to boasting of their relation to God, when he says, <b><i>and knows his will</i></b>, i.e., what God wants us to do: <b><i>that you may prove what is the will of God</i></b> (Rom 12:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    The second corresponds to their resting in the law, when he says, <b><i>and approves the more profitable things</i></b>, i.e., you know to select not only good from bad things but also better from less good. Hence someone asked: <i>which is the great commandment?</i> (Matt 22:36).
    <br />
    <br />
    And this, <b><i>being instructed by the law</i></b>: <i>blessed is the man whom you will instruct, O Lord, and will teach him out of your law</i> (Ps 93:12)
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph229"></span>
    <b>229.</b> Then he mentions its fruit with respect to others who find themselves in three different situations, so far as knowledge of the law is concerned.
    <br />
    <br />
    For some are entirely ignorant of the law, because they lack natural talent, just as a man is physically blind, because he lacks visual power: <i>we grope for the wall like the blind</i> (Isa 59:10). To such persons cannot be given the light of knowledge enabling them to see by themselves what to do; rather, they must be led, as the blind are, by commanding them to do this or that, even though they do not understand the reason for the command: <i>I became an eye to the blind</i> (Job 29:15); <i>they are blind and leaders of the blind</i> (Matt 15:14).
    <br />
    <br />
    Others are ignorant through lack of training, being as it were in the exterior darkness and not enlightened by teaching. To such persons a wise man can offer the light of training, so that they will understand what is commanded. This is why he says, <b><i>a light of those who are in darkness</i></b>: <i>to give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death</i> (Luke 1:79).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph230"></span>
    <b>230.</b> Second, he touches on those who are on the way to knowledge they have not yet attained, in one way through lack of full instruction; hence he says, <b><i>an instructor of the foolish</i></b>, i.e., of those who have not yet received wisdom who are said to be instructed, i.e., free from ignorance which is present in everyone from the beginning when they are first instructed: <i>do you have children? Discipline them</i> (Sir 7:23).
    <br />
    <br />
    In another way, through lack of age, as children. Hence he says, <b><i>a teacher of infants</i></b>: <i>where is the teacher of little ones?</i> (Isa 33:18).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph231"></span>
    <b>231.</b> A third group are already advanced in knowledge, but they need instruction from the wise in order to possess the authoritative sayings of wisdom as their rule or pattern. In regard to this he says, <b><i>having the form of knowledge</i></b>: <i>follow the pattern of the sound words which you have heard from me</i> (2 Tim 1:13); <i>mark those who so live as you have an example in us</i> (Phil 3:17).
    <br />
    <br />
    However, people so patterned must be instructed by the authority of their forebears, if they are to know what has been handed down <b><i>in the law</i></b>. Therefore, he says, <b><i>of knowledge</i></b>: <i>wisdom gave him knowledge of holy things</i> (Wis 10:10).
    <br />
    <br />
    This is also necessary if they are to know the true understanding of what has been handed down. That is why he says, <b><i>and of truth</i></b>: <i>send out your light and your truth</i> (Ps 43:3).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph232"></span>
    <b>232.</b> Then when he says <b><i>you who teaches another</i></b>, he indicates some of their failings.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, failings toward themselves, when he says <b><i>you who teaches another</i></b>, by directing them to the good, <b><i>teaches not yourself</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    This can be taken as a question asked with an overtone of indignation or with an overtone of mildness which, nevertheless, suggests wickedness on their part, as it does in Job: <i>behold, you have instructed many . . . the scourge has now touched you and you faint</i> (Job 4:3–5).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph233"></span>
    <b>233.</b> Second, their failings toward their neighbor.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, in regard to things taken furtively, when he says: <b><i>you who preaches against stealing, steals</i></b>. <i>Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves</i> (Isa 1:23).
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, in regard to defiling another person through adultery, when he says: <b><i>you who say men should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery?</i></b> <i>They are all adulterers, like a heated oven</i> (Hos 7:4); <i>each neighing for his neighbor’s wife</i> (Jer 5:8).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph234"></span>
    <b>234.</b> Third, he indicates their failings with respect to God: first, that they sin against his worship, when he says, <b><i>you, who abhors idols</i></b>, since you know from the law that they are not to be adored, <b><i>committs sacrilege</i></b> by abusing the things of divine worship.
    <br />
    <br />
    This they did during the old law: <i>you profane it when you say that the Lord’s table is polluted</i> (Mal 1:12) and later, when they blasphemed Christ: <i>it is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons</i> (Matt 12:24).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph235"></span>
    <b>235.</b> Second, that they sin against his glory, when he says: <b><i>you, who makes your boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonors God</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    For as observance of the law by good works is an occasion for others to honor God, so its transgression by evil works is an occasion for others to blaspheme: <i>that they may see your good deeds and glorify God</i> (1 Pet 2:12).
    <br />
    <br />
    Hence, he says: <i>let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be defamed</i> (1 Tim 6:1), and in a psalm it is said: <i>I look at the faithless with disgust, because they do not keep your commands</i> (Ps 119:158).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph236"></span>
    <b>236.</b> In support of this he quotes an authority, when he says, <b><i>the name of God through you is blasphemed among the gentiles</i></b>, i.e., because the gentiles, noting the evil practices of the Jews, laid it to evil training dictated by the law.
    <br />
    <br />
    He says: <b><i>as it is written</i></b>, namely, in Isaiah: <i>their rulers wail, and continually all the day my name is despised</i> (Isa 52:5) and in Ezekiel: <i>it is not for your sake, O house of Israel, but for the sake of my holy name which you have profaned among the nations</i> (Ezek 36:22).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph237"></span>
    <b>237.</b> Then when he says <b><i>circumcision</i></b>, he shows that circumcision is not sufficient for salvation any more than the law is, and for the same reason, namely, that without circumcision there is value in the law’s observance, without which circumcision has no benefit, as was said above.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to this he does three things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he compares circumcision to the circumcised Jews;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, to the uncircumcised gentiles, at <b><i>if then, the uncircumcised</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, he explains what he had said, at <b><i>for he is not a Jew who is so outwardly</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he shows how circumcision is of value;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, how not, at <b><i>but if you be a transgressor</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph238"></span>
    <b>238.</b> First, therefore, he says: <b><i>circumcision profits indeed</i></b>, inasmuch as it remits original sin; hence, it is written: <i>any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people</i> (Gen 17:14). But it will benefit you as an adult, <b><i>if you keep the law</i></b>, just as profession benefits a religious, if he keeps the rule. For circumcision is a form of profession obliging men to observe the law: <i>I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is bound to keep the whole law</i> (Gal 5:3).
    <br />
    <br />
    However, the Apostle’s statement that <i>if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you</i> (Gal 5:2), refers to the era after grace; but now he is referring to the time before the passion of Christ, when circumcision had status.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph239"></span>
    <b>239.</b> Second, at <b><i>but if you be a transgressor</i></b>, he shows how circumcision has no value, when he says: <b><i>if you</i></b>, a Jewish adult, <b><i>be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision</i></b>, i.e., has no more value than your previous condition, because you do not observe what you profess by circumcision: <i>all these nations are uncircumcised and all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart</i> (Jer 9:26). In fact they are more guilty for not observing what they promised: <i>a foolish and faithless promise displeases him</i> (Eccl 5:3).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph240"></span>
    <b>240.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>if then, the uncircumcised</i></b>, he considers circumcision in relation to the gentiles in two ways.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, from the aspect that the gentiles obtain the benefits of circumcision by observing the law. Hence he says: since circumcision profits, if the law is observed, but not, if it is not; then, <b><i>if then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law</i></b>, i.e., the moral precepts of the law: <i>all your commandments are true</i> (Ps 119:86), <b><i>will not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</i></b> As if to say: he will enjoy the fruit of true circumcision.
    <br />
    <br />
    For a man is circumcised outwardly in the flesh in order to circumcise himself in the heart: <i>circumcise yourselves to the Lord, remove the foreskin of your hearts</i> (Jer 4:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph241"></span>
    <b>241.</b> Second, at <b><i>and will not that which by nature</i></b>, he shows that on account of observing the law the gentile is preferred to the Jew. Hence he says, <b><i>will not that which by nature is uncircumcision</i></b>, i.e., an uncircumcised gentile, <b><i>if it fulfill the law</i></b> through natural reason, <b><i>judge you</i></b>, the circumcised Jew, <b><i>who by the letter is a transgressor of the law</i></b>, by transgressing the precepts of the law, and have <b><i>circumcision</i></b>, i.e., of the flesh. Hence on the basis of this comparison it is written: <i>the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation</i> (Matt 12:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph242"></span>
    <b>242.</b> Then when he says <b><i>for he is not a Jew who is so outwardly</i></b>, he assigns the reason for his statements.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he gives the reason;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he proves it, at <b><i>whose praise</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he assigns the reason why circumcision or Judaism without observance of the law is fruitless;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, why observance of the law without Judaism and circumcision has value, at <b><i>but he who is one inwardly</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph243"></span>
    <b>243.</b> He says, therefore, that circumcision in one who breaks the law is uncircumcision and will be judged by the uncircumcised who obey the law, <b><i>for he is not a</i></b> real <b><i>Jew, who is so outwardly</i></b>, according to carnal birth: <b><i>for all are not Israelites that are of</i></b> the circumcision, <b><i>but they who are the children of the promise</i></b> (Rom 9:6, 8). Similarly, true circumcision is not that which appears in the flesh, for it is a sign: <i>it shall be a sign of the covenant between you and me</i> (Gen 17:11). But it is not a true sign, unless the reality signified corresponds to it. Hence, if a Jew transgressed the covenant, his circumcision would not be true; consequently, it would be regarded as uncircumcision.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph244"></span>
    <b>244.</b> Then when he says <b><i>but he who is one inwardly</i></b>, he assigns the reason why the uncircumcision of one who keeps the law is regarded as circumcision and will judge bodily circumcision. The reason is that <b><i>he is</i></b> truly <b><i>a Jew who is one inwardly</i></b>, i.e., whose heart is possessed by the precepts of the law, which the Jews professed: <i>your Father who sees in secret will repay you</i> (Matt 6:6).
    <br />
    <br />
    Again, true <b><i>circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit</i></b>, i.e., made by one’s spirit, which expels superfluous thoughts from the heart. Or <b><i>in the spirit</i></b>, i.e., effected by a spiritual understanding of the law, and <b><i>not in the letter</i></b>: <i>for we are the true circumcision who worship God in spirit</i> (Phil 3:3).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph245"></span>
    <b>245.</b> Then when he says <b><i>whose praise</i></b> he proves this reason.
    <br />
    <br />
    For it is obvious that in all matters the divine judgment must prevail over the human. Now things that appear outwardly, such as Judaism or circumcision, are praised by men, but things that exist within are judged according to God’s judgment, because <i>man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart</i> (1 Sam 16:7).
    <br />
    <br />
    Hence, inward Judaism and circumcision prevail over the outward. And this is what he says: <b><i>whose praise</i></b>, i.e., of inward circumcision, <b><i>is not of men but of God</i></b>: <i>it is not the man who commends himself that is accepted, but the man whom the Lord commends</i> (2 Cor 10:18).
