  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>2:1</sup> Wherefore you are inexcusable, O man, whosoever you are who judges. For wherein you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you do the same things which you judge.<br><sup>2:2</sup> For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against those who do such things.<br><sup>2:3</sup> But do you think this, O man, who judges those who do such things and does the same, that you shall escape the judgment of God?<br><sup>2:4</sup> Or do you despise the riches of his goodness and patience and longsuffering? Do you not know that the benignity of God leads you to penance?<br><sup>2:5</sup> But according to your hardness and impenitent heart, you treasure up to yourself wrath, against the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgment of God:</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>2:6</sup> Who will render to every man according to his works;<br><sup>2:7</sup> To those indeed who, according to patience in good work, seek glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life:<br><sup>2:8</sup> But to those who are contentious and who obey not the truth but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.<br><sup>2:9</sup> Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who works evil: of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.<br><sup>2:10</sup> But glory and honor and peace to everyone who works good: to the Jew first, and also to the Greek;<br><sup>2:11</sup> For there is no respect of persons with God.<br><sup>2:12</sup> For whosoever has sinned without the law will perish without the law: and whosoever has sinned in the law will be judged by the law.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>2:13</sup> For the hearers of the law are not just before God: but the doers of the law will be justified.<br><sup>2:14</sup> For when the gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; they, having not the law, are a law to themselves,<br><sup>2:15</sup> Who show the work of the law written in their hearts,<br>their conscience bearing witness to them: and their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another,<br><sup>2:16</sup> In the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture4.html"><sup>2:17</sup> But if you are called a Jew and rest in the law and make your boast of God,<br><sup>2:18</sup> And know his will and approve the more profitable things, being instructed by the law:<br><sup>2:19</sup> Are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness,<br><sup>2:20</sup> An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.<br><sup>2:21</sup> You therefore, who teaches another, teaches not yourself: you, who preaches that men should not steal, steals.<br><sup>2:22</sup> You, who says men should not commit adultery, committs adultery: you, who abhors idols, committs sacrilege:<br><sup>2:23</sup> You, who makes your boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonors God.<br><sup>2:24</sup> (For <i>the name of God through you is blasphemed among the gentiles</i>, as it is written.)<br><sup>2:25</sup> Circumcision profits indeed, if you keep the law: but if you be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision.<br><sup>2:26</sup> If then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, will not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?<br><sup>2:27</sup> And will not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfill the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision is a transgressor of the law?<br><sup>2:28</sup> For he is not a Jew, who is so outwardly: nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh.<br><sup>2:29</sup> But he is a Jew that is one inwardly and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter: whose praise is not of men, but of God.</a>
