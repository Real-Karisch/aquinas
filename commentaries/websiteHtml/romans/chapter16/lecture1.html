    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1193"></span>
    <b>1193.</b> After mentioning certain personal matters about himself to the Romans to whom he was writing, the Apostle now presents certain personal matters pertaining to others.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to this he does three things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he suggests what they should do for others;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he tells what others do to them, at <b><i>all the churches</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, he ends the epistle with thanksgiving, at <b><i>but to him that is able</i></b> (Rom 16:25).
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he indicates whom they should welcome;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he shows whom they should avoid, at <b><i>now I beseech you</i></b> (Rom 16:17).
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he requests that certain persons in particular be welcomed;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he points out in a general way how to greet them, at <b><i>greet one another</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, he greets them on the part of the faithful, at <b><i>all the churches of Christ</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1194"></span>
    <b>1194.</b> In regard to the first he mentions a certain Corinthian woman who went to Rome. He recommends her to them, describing her, first of all, by name, saying: <b><i>I commend to you Phoebe</i></b>, who although devoted to God, did not have sufficient influence not to need letters of recommendation, as he once said of himself: <i>do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation?</i> (2 Cor 3:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, he describes her religion and faith, saying <b><i>our sister</i></b>. For all the women believers were called sisters and all the men brothers: <i>you are all brothers</i> (Matt 23:8).
    <br />
    <br />
    Third, from her pious activity, when he says: <b><i>who is in the ministry of the church that is in Cenchreae</i></b>, a port city of the Corinthians, where some Christians were gathered whom this woman had served, just as it was said of Christ himself (Luke 8:3) that certain women provided for him out of their means. And about the widow to be enrolled 1 Timothy says: <i>if she has shown hospitality and has washed the feet of the saints</i> (1 Tim 5:10).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1195"></span>
    <b>1195.</b> Then he mentions two things he wants done for her, the first of which is that she be honorably received. And this is what he says: <b><i>that you receive her in the Lord</i></b>, i.e., for the love of God, <b><i>as befits the saints</i></b>, i.e., according as it is fitting to receive saints, for it says in Matthew: <i>he who receives a just man because he is a just man shall receive a just man’s reward</i> (Matt 10:41).
    <br />
    <br />
    Instead of <b><i>as befits the saints</i></b>, some books have <i>worthily enough</i>, i.e., fittingly; but those texts do not agree with the Greek.
    <br />
    <br />
    The second is that they be solicitous in helping her; hence he adds: <b><i>and that you assist her</i></b>, namely, by affording advice and aid in any enterprise she may need you. For she possibly had something to settle in Caesar’s curia.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1196"></span>
    <b>1196.</b> But 1 Thessalonians seems to be opposed to this recommendation, for it says: <i>take care of your own business</i> (1 Thess 4:11). As if to say: do not get involved in other people’s affairs.
    <br />
    <br />
    The answer is that one can help in another’s affairs in two ways: first, in a worldly way, i.e., for the favor of men or for gain; and this does not befit God’s servants. <i>No soldier of God gets entangled in civilian pursuits</i> (2 Tim 2:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    In another way someone may help in another’s affairs out of piety; for example, to help the needy and the wretched, and this is religious according to James: <i>religion pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained from this world</i> (Jas 1:27). It is in this way that the Apostle speaks here.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1197"></span>
    <b>1197.</b> Finally, the Apostle tells why this is owed to her, saying: <b><i>for she also has assisted many, and myself also</i></b>: <i>tell the just that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds</i> (Isa 3:10); <i>blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy</i> (Matt 5:7).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1198"></span>
    <b>1198.</b> Then he recommends other persons connected with him to be greeted, saying: <b><i>greet Prisca and Aquila</i></b>, who was her husband, but he mentions her first, perhaps because of the greater devotion of her faith, <b><i>my helpers in Christ</i></b>, i.e., in preaching the faith of Christ.
    <br />
    <br />
    For he stayed with them in Corinth, as is found in Acts (Acts 18:1–3).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1199"></span>
    <b>1199.</b> <b><i>Who have for my life laid down their own necks</i></b>, i.e., put themselves in danger of death to save my life, an indication of the greatest charity: <i>greater love has no man than that he lay down his life for his friends</i> (John 15:13).
    <br />
    <br />
    This seems to have happened at Corinth where Paul suffered persecution, as is found in Acts (Acts 18:6). Or perhaps it is better to say that others exposed themselves to danger for the Apostle. For what is read in Acts (Acts 18:21) occurred when Prisca and Aquila left Rome for Corinth. But the Apostle wrote this, when he thought they were still at Rome.
    <br />
    <br />
    Now the Apostle’s life was necessary not so much for himself as for others, as he says in Philippians: <i>but to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account</i> (Phil 1:24). Therefore he continues: <b><i>to whom not only I give thanks but also all the churches of the gentiles</i></b>, whose apostle and teacher I am: <i>a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth</i> (1 Tim 2:7); <b><i>greet</i></b> also <b><i>the church which is in their house</i></b>. For they had many believers assembled in their house.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1200"></span>
    <b>1200.</b> Then he wants another person joined to him by love to be greeted, saying: <b><i>greet Epenetus, my beloved, who is the firstfruits of Asia in Christ</i></b>. This lent him great dignity: <i>you have come to the assembly of the firstborn, who are enrolled in heaven</i> (Heb 12:23). But at that time he was in Rome.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1201"></span>
    <b>1201.</b> Then he says: <b><i>greet Mary, who has labored much among you</i></b> to restore concord among them, and when she failed in her endeavor, she notified the Apostle: <i>the fruit of good labors is renowned</i> (Wis 3:15).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1202"></span>
    <b>1202.</b> Then he says, <b><i>greet Andronicus and Junias</i></b>, whom he describes, first, from their race when he says: <b><i>my kinsmen</i></b>. This shows that they were Jews, about whom he said above: <b><i>who are my kinsmen according to the flesh</i></b> (Rom 9:3). Second, from the suffering they endured for Christ, saying <b><i>and fellow prisoners</i></b>. For they had been in prison once with the Apostle: <i>with far more imprisonments</i> (2 Cor 11:23). Third, from their authority when he says: <b><i>who are of note among the apostles</i></b>, i.e., noble among the preachers: <i>her husband is honorable in the gates</i> (Prov 31:23).<br/>Fourth, from the time, when he says: <b><i>who also were in Christ before me</i></b>. For they had been converted before the Apostle and thus were owed greater respect: <i>do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as you would a father</i> (1 Tim 5:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1203"></span>
    <b>1203.</b> Then he says, <b><i>greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord</i></b>, beloved in the love of charity, which is in Christ: <i>God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus</i> (Phil 1:8).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1204"></span>
    <b>1204.</b> Then he says, <b><i>greet Urbanus, our helper in Christ</i></b>, i.e., in preaching the faith: <i>a brother helped is like a strong city</i> (Prov 18:19), <b><i>and Stachys, my beloved</i></b>. He mentions them together, perhaps because they lived together or were connected in some other way.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1205"></span>
    <b>1205.</b> Then he says, <b><i>greet Apellas, approved in Christ</i></b>, perhaps through certain tribulations: <i>when he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold</i> (Job 23:10).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1206"></span>
    <b>1206.</b> Then he says, <b><i>greet those who are of the house</i></b>, i.e., of the family, <b><i>of Aristobulus</i></b>, in whose house many believers were gathered whom he does not greet, perhaps because he was absent for some reason. Then he says, <b><i>greet my kinsman Herodion</i></b>, who from the designation is said to be Jewish.
    <br />
    <br />
    Then he says, <b><i>greet those who are of Narcissus’ house</i></b>, who is said to have been a presbyter and wandered through desert places to comfort the faithful. Hence the Apostle, knowing that he was away, did not ask that he be greeted but his family.
    <br />
    <br />
    Yet there were some unbelievers in this family, and therefore to note the difference, he says: <b><i>who are in the Lord</i></b>, because he was asking only believers to be greeted: <i>if anyone comes to you and does not bring the doctrine, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting</i> (2 John 5:10).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1207"></span>
    <b>1207.</b> Then he says, <b><i>greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord</i></b>, i.e., in ministering to the saints, which the Lord regards as done to himself, as it says in Matthew: <i>as you did it to one of these, the least of my brethren, you did it to me</i> (Matt 25:40).
    <br />
    <br />
    Then he says, <b><i>greet Persis, the dearly beloved</i></b>, whom the Apostle especially loved for his devotion. Hence he adds: <b><i>who has labored much in the Lord</i></b>, i.e., by exhorting others and ministering to the saints, and even in poverty and other spiritual works: <i>in toil and hardship, in hunger and thirst</i> (2 Cor 11:27).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1208"></span>
    <b>1208.</b> Then he says, <b><i>greet Rufus, elect in the Lord</i></b>, i.e., in the grace of Christ: <i>he chose us in him before the foundation of the world</i> (Eph 1:4); <b><i>also his mother</i></b>, according to the flesh, <b><i>and mine</i></b>, because she was his mother as a benefactor. For she had served the Apostle at one time, although she was not in Rome: <i>older women like mothers, younger women like sisters, in all purity</i> (1 Tim 5:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1209"></span>
    <b>1209.</b> Then he says, <b><i>greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren who are with them</i></b>. He greets them together, because they lived together in harmony: <i>God gives the lonely a home to live in</i> (Ps 68:6).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1210"></span>
    <b>1210.</b> Then he says, <b><i>greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympias and all the saints who are with them</i></b>, i.e., sanctified in the faith of Christ: <i>you were washed, you were sanctified</i> (1 Cor 6:11).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1211"></span>
    <b>1211.</b> Then he shows them in general how to greet others, saying: <b><i>greet one another with a holy kiss</i></b>, which he says to distinguish it from a sensual kiss, about which Proverbs says: <i>she seizes him and kisses him</i> (Prov 7:13); and to distinguish it from a deceitful kiss, about which Proverbs says: <i>better are wounds from a friend than the fraudulent kisses of an enemy</i> (Prov 27:6).
    <br />
    <br />
    The holy kiss is given as a sign of the blessed Trinity: <i>O that he would kiss me with the kiss of his mouth</i> (Song 1:2). From this the custom arose in the Church whereby the faithful give one another the kiss of peace during the solemnities of the Mass.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph1212"></span>
    <b>1212.</b> Then he greets them on behalf of the other churches, saying: <b><i>all the churches of Christ greet you</i></b>, i.e., those assembled in the name and faith of Christ, because all wish your salvation and pray for you: <i>pray for one another, that you may be saved</i> (Jas 5:16).
