  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>16:1</sup> But I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is in the ministry of the church that is in Cenchrae:<br><sup>16:2</sup> That you receive her in the Lord as befits the saints and that you assist her in whatsoever business she will have need of you.

  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>16:17</sup> But I beseech you, brethren, to mark those who make dissensions and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them.<br><sup>16:18</sup> For they who are such serve not Christ our Lord but their own belly: and by pleasing speeches and good words seduce the hearts of the innocent.<br><sup>16:19</sup> For your obedience is published in every place. I rejoice therefore in you. But I would have you to be wise in good and simple in evil.<br><sup>16:20</sup> But may the God of peace crush Satan under your feet speedily. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.<br><sup>16:21</sup> Timothy, my helper, greets you: and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.<br><sup>16:22</sup> I, Tertius, who wrote this epistle, greet you in the Lord.<br><sup>16:23</sup> Caius, my host, and the whole church greet you.

Amen.<br><sup>16:25</sup> Now to him who is able to establish you, according to my Gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret for eternal ages;<br><sup>16:26</sup> Which now is made manifest through the writings of the prophets, according to the precept of the eternal God, for the obedience of faith known among all nations:<br><sup>16:27</sup> To God, the only wise, through Jesus Christ, to whom be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</a>
