  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>3:1</sup> What advantage then has the Jew: or what is the profit of circumcision?<br><sup>3:2</sup> Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.<br><sup>3:3</sup> For what if some of them have not believed? Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?<br><sup>3:4</sup> God forbid! But God is true and every man a liar, as it is written: <i>that you may be justified in your words and may overcome when you are judged</i>.<br><sup>3:5</sup> But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executes wrath? (I speak according to man.)<br><sup>3:6</sup> God forbid! Otherwise how shall God judge this world?<br><sup>3:7</sup> For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?<br><sup>3:8</sup> And not rather (as we are slandered and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil that there may come good? Whose damnation is just.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>3:9</sup> What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.<br><sup>3:10</sup> As it is written: <i>there is not any just man</i>.<br><sup>3:11</sup> <i>There is none who understands: there is none who seeks after God</i>.<br><sup>3:12</sup> <i>All have turned out of the way: they have become unprofitable together: there is none who does good, there is not so much as one</i>.<br><sup>3:13</sup> <i>Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips</i>,<br><sup>3:14</sup> <i>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness</i>:<br><sup>3:15</sup> <i>Their feet swift to shed blood</i>:<br><sup>3:16</sup> <i>Destruction and misery in their ways</i>:<br><sup>3:17</sup> <i>And the way of peace they have not known</i>.<br><sup>3:18</sup> <i>There is no fear of God before their eyes</i>.<br><sup>3:19</sup> Now we know that what things soever the law speaks, it speaks to those who are in the law: that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be made subject to God.<br><sup>3:20</sup> Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>3:21</sup> But now, without the law, the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.<br><sup>3:22</sup> Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all those who believe in him: for there is no distinction.<br><sup>3:23</sup> For all have sinned and do need the glory of God.<br><sup>3:24</sup> Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,<br><sup>3:25</sup> Whom God has proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the showing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,<br><sup>3:26</sup> Through the forbearance of God, for the showing of his justice in this time: that he himself may be just and the justifier of him who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture4.html"><sup>3:27</sup> Where is then your boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.<br><sup>3:28</sup> For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.<br><sup>3:29</sup> Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the gentiles? yes, of the gentiles also.<br><sup>3:30</sup> For it is one God who justifies circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith.<br><sup>3:31</sup> Do we then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid! But we establish the law.</a>
