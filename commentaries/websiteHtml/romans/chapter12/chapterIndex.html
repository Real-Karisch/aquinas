  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>12:1</sup> I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing unto God, your reasonable service.<br><sup>12:2</sup> And be not conformed to this world, but be reformed in the newness of your sense, that you may perceive what is the good and the acceptable and the perfect will of God.<br><sup>12:3</sup> For I say, by the grace that is given me, to all that are among you, not to be more wise than is fitting to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety and according as God has divided to each one the measure of faith.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>12:4</sup> For as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same act:<br><sup>12:5</sup> So we, being many, are one body in Christ; and every one members one of another:<br><sup>12:6</sup> And having different gifts, according to the grace that is given us, either prophecy, to be used according to the rule of faith;<br><sup>12:7</sup> Or ministry, in ministering; or he who teaches, in doctrine;<br><sup>12:8</sup> He who exhorts, in exhorting; he who contributes, in simplicity; he who rules, in carefulness; he who does acts of mercy, in cheerfulness.<br><sup>12:9</sup> Let love be without dissimulation. Hating evil, cleaving to good,<br><sup>12:10</sup> Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood; with honor anticipating one another;<br><sup>12:11</sup> In carefulness, not slothful; in spirit, fervent; serving the Lord;<br><sup>12:12</sup> Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; constant in prayer;<br><sup>12:13</sup> Communicating to the necessities of the saints; pursuing hospitality.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>12:14</sup> Bless those who persecute you: bless, and curse not.<br><sup>12:15</sup> Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep:<br><sup>12:16</sup> Being of one mind one towards another: not minding high things, but consenting to the humble. Do not be prudent among you yourselves:<br><sup>12:17</sup> To no man rendering evil for evil: providing good things, not only in the sight of God but also in the sight of all men.<br><sup>12:18</sup> If it be possible, as much as is in you, have peace with all men:<br><sup>12:19</sup> Revenge not yourselves, my dearly beloved, but give place unto wrath.<br>For it is written: <i>vengeance is mine, I will repay</i>, saith the Lord.<br><sup>12:20</sup> But if the enemy be hungry, feed him: if he is thirsty, give him drink: for, doing this, you will heap coals of fire upon his head.<br><sup>12:21</sup> Be not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil by good.</a>
