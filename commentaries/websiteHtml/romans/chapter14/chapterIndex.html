  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>14:1</sup> Now him who is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.<br><sup>14:2</sup> For one believes that he may eat all things: but he who is weak, let him eat herbs.<br><sup>14:3</sup> Let him who eats despise not him who eats not: and he who eats not, let him not judge him that eats. For God has taken him to him.<br><sup>14:4</sup> Who are you that judges another man’s servant?<br>To his own lord he stands or falls. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.<br><sup>14:5</sup> For one judges between day and day: and another judges every day. Let every man abound in his own sense.<br><sup>14:6</sup> He who regards the day regards it unto the Lord. And he who eats, eats to the Lord: for he gives thanks to God. And he who eats not, to the Lord he eats not and gives thanks to God.<br><sup>14:7</sup> For none of us lives to himself: and no one dies to himself.<br><sup>14:8</sup> For if we live, we live unto the Lord: or if we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord’s.<br><sup>14:9</sup> For to this end Christ died and rose again: that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.<br><sup>14:10</sup> But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.<br><sup>14:11</sup> For it is written: <i>as I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God</i>.<br><sup>14:12</sup> Therefore every one of us shall render an account to God for himself.<br><sup>14:13</sup> Let us not therefore judge one another any more.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>14:13</sup> But judge this rather, that you put not a stumbling block or a scandal in your brother’s way.<br><sup>14:14</sup> I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is common of itself: but to him who esteems any thing to be common, to him it is common.<br><sup>14:15</sup> For if, because of food, your brother be grieved, you no longer walk according to charity. Destroy not him with your food, for whom Christ died.<br><sup>14:16</sup> Let not then our good be evil spoken of.<br><sup>14:17</sup> For the kingdom of God is not food and drink: but justice and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.<br><sup>14:18</sup> For he who in this serves Christ pleases God and is approved of men.<br><sup>14:19</sup> Therefore, let us follow after the things that are of peace and keep the things that are of edification, one towards another.<br><sup>14:20</sup> Destroy not the work of God for food.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>14:20</sup> All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eats with offense.<br><sup>14:21</sup> It is good not to eat flesh and not to drink wine: nor any thing whereby your brother is offended or scandalized or made weak.<br><sup>14:22</sup> Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Blessed is he who condemns not himself in that which he allows.<br><sup>14:23</sup> But he who discerns, if he eats, is condemned; because he does not act from faith. For all that is not of faith is sin.</a>
