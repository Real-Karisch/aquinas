    <b>359.</b> After showing that the promise made to Abraham and his seed was not to be fulfilled through the law, the Apostle now shows that it is to be fulfilled through faith.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to this he does three things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he shows through what such a promise is to be fulfilled;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, in whom it is to be fulfilled, at <b><i>to all the seed</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, by whom it is to be fulfilled, at <b><i>who quickens the dead</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph360"></span>
    <b>360.</b> First, therefore, he concludes to his proposition, as it were by division.
    <br />
    <br />
    For it seems necessary that the promise be fulfilled either by faith or by the law; but not by the law, because the promise would be abolished. Hence, he concludes, <b><i>therefore it is of faith</i></b>, if we are to attain the promise of being heirs of the world: <i>this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith</i> (1 John 5:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    Then he confirms this with a middle term contrary to the one he used above. For it was stated that if justice were from the law, the promise would be abolished; but if it be from faith, the promise remains solid in virtue of the power of divine grace justifying man through faith. And that is what he says, <b><i>that the promise</i></b> of God <b><i>might be firm</i></b> not on actions, which can fall short, but <b><i>according to grace</i></b>, which is infallible: <i>my grace is sufficient for you</i> (2 Cor 12:9); <i>for all the promises of God are in him</i>, namely, Christ, i.e., they are true (2 Cor 1:20).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph361"></span>
    <b>361.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>to all the seed</i></b>, he shows in whom this promise is fulfilled.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he proposes what he intends and says that this promise, which is to be thus fulfilled through faith, is guaranteed by grace <b><i>to all the seed</i></b>, i.e., to every man who would be in any way descended from Abraham: <i>their prosperity will remain with their descendants, and their inheritance to their children’s children</i> (Sir 44:11).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph362"></span>
    <b>362.</b> Second, at <b><i>not to that only</i></b>, he explains what he meant by <b><i>all the seed</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    For there is a bodily descendant: <i>we are the descendants of Abraham</i> (John 8:33), and there is a spiritual descendant: <i>God is able from these stones</i>, i.e., from the gentiles, <i>to raise up children to Abraham</i> (Matt 3:9). Only the bodily descendants of Abraham kept the law, but the spiritual descendants also imitate his faith.
    <br />
    <br />
    Thus, if the promise were solely through the law, it would be fulfilled not in all the descendants but only in the bodily ones. But because it is fulfilled through faith, which is common to all, it is plain that it is fulfilled in all his descendants.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph363"></span>
    <b>363.</b> Third, at <b><i>who is the father</i></b>, he proves something he had presupposed, namely, that the descendants of Abraham are not only the children of the law but also the children of faith. He proves this with a text from Scripture. First, he gives its sense, saying, <b><i>who</i></b>, namely, Abraham, <b><i>is the father of us all</i></b>, i.e., of all believers, Jew or gentile: <b><i>that he might be the father of all them that believe</i></b> (Rom 4:11); <i>look to Abraham, your father</i> (Isa 51:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, he cites the text, saying, <b><i>as it is written</i></b>: <b><i>I have made you a father of many nations</i></b> (Gen 17:4). Another version has, <b><i>I have appointed you</i></b>. But it does not change the sense. <i>Abraham was the great father of a multitude of nations</i> (Sir 44:19).
    <br />
    <br />
    Third, at <b><i>before God</i></b>, he explains what he had said. For <b><i>I have made you</i></b> seems to imply that something destined to be fulfilled in the distant future had already come to pass. However, things that are future in themselves are present in God’s providence: <i>before the universe was created, it was known to him; so it was also after it was finished</i> (Sir 23:20). Accordingly, the Apostle says that the statement, <b><i>I have made you</i></b>, should be understood <b><i>before God</i></b>, i.e., in his presence, <b><i>whom he believed</i></b>. For Abraham had believed God promising things to come as if he saw them present, because, as is stated in Hebrews: <i>faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen</i> (Heb 11:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph364"></span>
    <b>364.</b> Then when he says <b><i>who quickens the dead</i></b> he shows by whom this promise is to be fulfilled, saying, <b><i>who</i></b>, namely, God, <b><i>quickens the dead</i></b>, i.e., the Jews, who were dead in sin for acting against the law; he vivifies with faith and grace to enable them to rea1ize the promise to Abraham: <i>as the Father raises the dead and gives them life so the Son gives life to whom he will</i> (John 5:21).
    <br />
    <br />
    <b><i>And calls those things that are not</i></b>, i.e., he calls the gentiles to grace <b><i>as those that are</i></b>, i.e., as the Jews: <b><i>I will call that which was not my people, my people</i></b> (Rom 9:25).
    <br />
    <br />
    He refers to the gentiles as <b><i>those things that are not</i></b>, because they were completely estranged from God, and it is stated in 1 Corinthians: <i>if I do not have charity, I am nothing</i> (1 Cor 13:2). Consequently, through this call the promise to Abraham is fulfilled even in the gentiles.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph365"></span>
    <b>365.</b> Or, <b><i>and calls those things that are not</i></b> refers not to one’s temporal calling but to the call of eternal predestination, because even those who are not, are called and chosen as if they were: <i>he chose us in him before the foundation of the world</i> (Eph 1:4). Concerning this call it is stated below: <b><i>not of works but of him who calls, it was said to her: the elder shall serve the younger</i></b> (Rom 9:12).
    <br />
    <br />
    Or he is calling God’s simple knowledge a call, or the knowledge by which he knows the future as present. This is the way it is taken in the Psalm: <i>he calls the stars by their names</i> (Ps 147:4). According to this sense, what is said here is mentioned on account of an earlier statement: <b><i>before God, whom he believed</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph366"></span>
    <b>366.</b> Two things seem to militate against what was said: <b><i>I have made you a father of many nations</i></b>. One of these was that Abraham was as good as dead from old age. Against this he says, <b><i>who quickens the dead</i></b>. The other is that those many nations did not exist yet. Against this he says: <b><i>and calls those things that are not, as those that are</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph367"></span>
    <b>367.</b> Then when he says <b><i>who against hope</i></b>, he commends Abraham’s faith.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he shows the greatness of his faith;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, its efficacy or fruit, at <b><i>and therefore it was reputed</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he shows the greatness of Abraham’s faith as far as the promise of multiplying his descendants is concerned;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, in regard to the promise to exalt his descendants, at <b><i>in the promise also</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he shows that his faith was great;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, that it was solid, at <b><i>and he was not weak in faith</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph368"></span>
    <b>368.</b> In regard to the first he does two things: first, he mentions the greatness of Abraham’s faith, saying, <b><i>who</i></b>, namely, Abraham, <b><i>believed</i></b> in this <b><i>hope, that he might be made the father of many nations</i></b>, but against another hope.
    <br />
    <br />
    Here it should be noted that <b><i>hope</i></b> implies a certain expectation of a future good, the certainty being based sometimes on a human or natural cause as in 1 Corinthians: <i>the plowman should plow in hope</i> (1 Cor 9:10), or on a divine cause as in the Psalm: <i>in you, O Lord, have I hoped</i> (Ps 30:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, in regard to this good of becoming the father of many nations Abraham had certainty on the part of God promising, but the contrary appeared on the part of natural or human causes. Hence, he says, <b><i>who against hope</i></b> of natural and human causes <b><i>believed in hope</i></b> of the divine promise.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph369"></span>
    <b>369.</b> Second, this promise is set out when he says, <b><i>according to that which was said to him</i></b>, namely, in Genesis: <i>so shall your seed be as the stars of heaven and as the sand on the seashore</i> (Gen 22:17).
    <br />
    <br />
    Both of these are mentioned, because they suggest an uncountable multitude. For as to the stars it is stated in Deuteronomy: <i>the Lord your God has multiplied you, and you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude</i> (Deut 1:10); as to the grains of sand it is stated in 1 Kings: <i>Judah and Israel were as many as the sand by the sea</i> (1 Kgs 4:20).
    <br />
    <br />
    Yet a difference between the two can be noted, if the just, who were of Abraham’s seed, be compared to the stars: <i>those who turn many to justice are like the stars forever and ever</i> (Dan 12:3) and sinners be compared to the grains of sand, because they are overcome by the waves of the world as of a sea: <i>I placed the sand as the bound for the sea</i> (Jer 5:22).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph370"></span>
    <b>370.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>and he was not weak</i></b>, he shows Abraham’s firmness. For as temperance is shown not to be weak, because it is not overcome by strong temptations, so faith is shown not to be weak but strong, because it is not overcome by great difficulties: <i>resist him, firm in your faith</i> (1 Pet 5:9).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph371"></span>
    <b>371.</b> Second, at <b><i>neither did he consider</i></b>, he mentions the difficulties from which it is shown that his faith was not weak.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, on the part of Abraham himself when he says, <b><i>neither did he consider</i></b>, namely, to question the promise, <b><i>his own body, now dead</i></b>, namely, because the reproductive power in it was slack on account of old age; hence he says, <b><i>whereas he was almost an hundred years old</i></b>. For Abraham was a hundred years old when Isaac was born (Gen 21:15) and it was the year before that a son had been promised him: <i>the Lord said: I will surely return to you in the spring, and Sarah your wife shall have a son</i> (Gen 18:10).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph372"></span>
    <b>372.</b> But it seems that his body was not dead as far as the reproductive power was concerned, because even after Sarah died he took another wife, Keturah, who bore him a number of sons, as is recorded in Genesis (Gen 25:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    Some answer that the reproductive power in him was dead as far as reproducing from an old woman was concerned, but not as far as reproducing from a young woman. For old men are wont to beget offspring from the young but not from old women, who are less fit for conception. However, it seems better to say that Abraham’s reproductive power was miraculously restored both in regard to Sarah and to all women.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph373"></span>
    <b>373.</b> Second, he mentions a difficulty on the part of the wife when he says, <b><i>nor the dead womb of Sarah</i></b>, i.e., he does not consider it so as to question the promise.
    <br />
    <br />
    He says, <b><i>dead</i></b>, on account of sterility as well as old age. For <i>it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women</i> (Gen 18:11). Hence in Isaiah, where it is written: <i>look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you</i> (Isa 51:2), the preceding passage says: <i>look to the rock from which you were hewn and to the quarry from which you were dug out</i>, in order to show the feebleness and frigidity of both.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph374"></span>
    <b>374.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>in the promise also of God</i></b>, he commends Abraham’s faith in the repeated promise that his seed would be exalted.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he mentions the firmness of faith;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, the cause of the firmness, at <b><i>giving glory to God</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph375"></span>
    <b>375.</b> First, therefore, he says: <b><i>in the promise also of God</i></b>, i.e., the promise that his seed would be exalted or that it would be multiplied, which was repeated: <i>look toward heaven and number the stars. . . . So shall your descendants be</i> (Gen 15:5); <i>you shall be the father of a multitude of nations</i> (Gen 17:4); <i>I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven</i> (Gen 22:17).
    <br />
    <br />
    Or, <b><i>in the promise of God</i></b> can refer to the exaltation of his descendants, because when he had said: <i>I will multiply your descendants</i>, he added at once: <i>and your descendants shall possess the gates of their enemies and by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth be blessed</i>.
    <br />
    <br />
    Concerning this promise of God <b><i>he staggered not by distrust</i></b>, i.e., he did not doubt the truth of the divine promise: <i>he who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind</i> (Jas 1:6); <b><i>but was strengthened in faith</i></b>, i.e., clung firmly to his belief: <i>resist him, firm in your faith</i> (1 Pet 5:9).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph376"></span>
    <b>376.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>giving glory to God</i></b>, he gives the reason why Abraham’s faith was firm, for he grew strong in his faith <b><i>giving glory to God</i></b> by considering his omnipotence: <i>great is his power</i> (Ps 147:5).
    <br />
    <br />
    Hence he continues: <b><i>most fully knowing that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform</i></b>: <i>you have power to act whenever you choose</i> (Wis 12:18).
    <br />
    <br />
    From this it is clear that whoever is not firm in faith detracts from God’s glory either in regard to his veracity or his power.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph377"></span>
    <b>377.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>and therefore it was reputed to him</i></b>, he commends Abraham’s faith in regard to its effect.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he mentions the effect it had in him, saying, <b><i>and therefore</i></b>, namely, because Abraham believed this so firmly, <b><i>it was reputed to him unto justice</i></b>: <i>and it was reckoned to him as justice</i> (1 Macc 2:52).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph378"></span>
    <b>378.</b> Second, he shows the effect which his faith had on others. In regard to this he does three things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he shows the likeness between the effect it had in him and in others, saying, <b><i>now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice</i></b>, so as to make us think that for Abraham alone faith was reckoned as justice, <b><i>but also for us, to whom it</i></b>, namely, faith, <b><i>shall be reputed</i></b> as justice: <b><i>what things soever were written were written for our learning</i></b> (Rom 15:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, it was written for him that he might be an example to us, and for us that he might raise our hope for justice.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph379"></span>
    <b>379.</b> Second, at <b><i>if we believe in him</i></b>, he shows a likeness in faith.
    <br />
    <br />
    For what was reckoned as justice was Abraham’s faith in believing that his body, as good as dead, and the barren womb of Sarah could be vivified for procreating children. <b><i>It shall be reputed</i></b> also to us <b><i>if we believe in him that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead</i></b> and in God the Father, to whom he says in a psalm: <i>but do you, O Lord, be gracious to me and raise me up</i> (Ps 41:10). And because the power of the Father and of the Son is the same, he also rose by his own power.
    <br />
    <br />
    That this faith justifies is shown below: <b><i>if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised him up from the dead, you shall be saved</i></b> (Rom 10:9).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph380"></span>
    <b>380.</b> Third, at <b><i>who was delivered up for our sins</i></b>, he assigns the cause why faith in the resurrection of Christ justifies, saying, <b><i>who</i></b>, namely, Christ, <b><i>was delivered up</i></b>, namely to death, by God the Father: <b><i>he that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up for us all</i></b> (Rom 8:32), by himself: <i>he gave himself up for us</i> (Eph 5:25), by Judas: <i>he who delivered me to you has the greater sin</i> (John 19:11), and by the Jews: <i>they will deliver him to the gentiles to be mocked</i> (Matt 20:19).
    <br />
    <br />
    <b><i>And rose again for our justification</i></b>, i.e., to justify us by rising: <b><i>that, as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life</i></b> (Rom 6:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    That he was put to death for our sins seems plain from the fact that by his death he merited the remission of our sins, but he did not merit by rising, because in the risen state he was not a pilgrim but one who had arrived.
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, it must be said that Christ’s death was salutary for us not only by way of merit but also by way of effecting it. For since Christ’s human nature was somehow the instrument of his divinity, as Damascene says, all the acts and sufferings of his human nature were salutary for us, considering that they flowed from the power of his divinity. But because an effect has to some extent a similarity to its cause, the Apostle says that Christ’s death, by which mortal life was extinguished in him, is the cause of extinguishing our sins. But his resurrection, by which he returns to a new life of glory, he calls the cause of our justification, by which we return to the new life of justice.
