  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>4:1</sup> What shall we say then that Abraham has found, who is our father according to the flesh?<br><sup>4:2</sup> For if Abraham were justified by works, he has glory, but not before God.<br><sup>4:3</sup> For what says the Scripture? <i>Abraham believed God: and it was reputed to him unto justice</i>.<br><sup>4:4</sup> Now to him who works, the reward is not reckoned according to grace but according to debt.<br><sup>4:5</sup> But to him who works not, yet believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.<br><sup>4:6</sup> As David also terms the blessedness of a man to whom God reputs justice without works:<br><sup>4:7</sup> <i>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven: and whose sins are covered</i>.<br><sup>4:8</sup> <i>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord has not imputed sin</i>.<br><sup>4:9</sup> This blessedness then, does it remain in the circumcision only or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that <i>unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice</i>.<br><sup>4:10</sup> How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>4:11</sup> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith which is in uncircumcision: that he might be the father of all those who believe, being uncircumcised: that unto them also it may be reputed to justice:<br><sup>4:12</sup> And he might be the father of circumcision; not to those only who are of the circumcision, but to those also who follow the steps of the faith that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.<br><sup>4:13</sup> For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world: but through the justice of faith.<br><sup>4:14</sup> For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void: the promise is made of no effect.<br><sup>4:15</sup> For the law works wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>4:16</sup> Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed: not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,<br><sup>4:17</sup> (As it is written: <i>I have made you a father of many nations</i>), before God, whom he believed: who quickens the dead and calls those things that are not, as those that are.<br><sup>4:18</sup> Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the father of many nations, according to that which was said to him: <i>so shall your seed be</i>.<br><sup>4:19</sup> And he was not weak in faith. Neither did he consider his own body, now dead (whereas he was almost an hundred years old), nor the dead womb of Sarah.<br><sup>4:20</sup> In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust: but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:<br><sup>4:21</sup> Most fully knowing that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.<br><sup>4:22</sup> And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.<br><sup>4:23</sup> Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice,<br><sup>4:24</sup> But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,<br><sup>4:25</sup> Who was delivered up for our sins and rose again for our justification.</a>
