    <b>878.</b> After showing that the fall of the Jews is not universal, the Apostle now begins to show that their fall was neither useless nor irreparable.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to this he does two things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he shows that the fall of the Jews is useful and reparable;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he disputes the gentiles’ boasting against the Jews, at <b><i>and if some of the branches</i></b> (Rom 11:17).
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he asks a question;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he answers it, at <b><i>God forbid</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph879"></span>
    <b>879.</b> First, therefore, he says: it has been stated and proved that except for the chosen, the rest of the Jews have been blinded. So the question arises: <b><i>have they so stumbled, that they should fall?</i></b>
    <br />
    <br />
    This can be interpreted in two ways: the first way is this: has God permitted them to stumble only <b><i>that they should fall</i></b>, i.e., not for any benefit that might follow but merely willing their fall? This, of course, would be contrary to God’s goodness which, as Augustine says, is so great that it would not permit any evil to occur except for some good, which he draws out of the evil. Hence it says in Job: <i>he shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead</i> (Job 34:24); and in Revelation: <i>hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown</i> (Rev 3:11), namely, because God permits some to fall in order that their fall be the occasion of salvation for others.
    <br />
    <br />
    Another interpretation is this: <b><i>have they so stumbled, that they should fall</i></b>, i.e., that they should remain fallen forever? <i>Will he not rise again from where he lies?</i> (Ps 41:8).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph880"></span>
    <b>880.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>God forbid</i></b>, he answers the question:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, according to the first interpretation, showing that the fall of the Jews was useful;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he resolves the question according to the second interpretation, showing that the Jews’ situation is reparable, at <b><i>now if the offense of them</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph881"></span>
    <b>881.</b> First, therefore, he says: <b><i>God forbid</i></b> that they fell to no use; <b><i>but</i></b> rather, <b><i>by their</i></b>, namely, the Jews’, <b><i>offense, salvation is come to the gentiles</i></b>. Hence the Lord himself says: <i>salvation is from the Jews</i> (John 4:22).
    <br />
    <br />
    This can be understood in three ways. In the first way, that <b><i>by their offense</i></b>, which they committed in killing Christ, the salvation of the gentiles was obtained through the redemption of Christ’s blood: <i>you know that you were ransomed not with perishable things, such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of the Lamb</i> (1 Pet 1:18).
    <br />
    <br />
    In the second way, it can be understood of the trespass by which they rejected the teaching of the apostles, with the result that the apostles preached to the gentiles, as it says in Acts: <i>it was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it from you, we turn to the gentiles</i> (Acts 13:46).
    <br />
    <br />
    In a third way it can be understood as meaning that on account of their impenitence they have been scattered among all the nations. As a result Christ and the Church had from the books of the Jews testimony to the Christian faith helpful in converting the gentiles, who might have suspected that the prophecies concerning Christ, which the preachers of the faith brought forward, were fabricated, if they had not been proven by the testimony of the Jews; hence it says in a psalm: <i>let me look in triumph on my enemies</i>, i.e., the Jews; <i>slay them not, lest my people forget, make them totter by your power</i> (Ps 59:10).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph882"></span>
    <b>882.</b> There follows <b><i>so that they may be emulous of them</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    And because he does not say who or whom, and since there are two kinds of emulousness, namely that of indignation and that of imitation, this phrase can be explained in four ways.
    <br />
    <br />
    The first way is this. <b><i>That the gentiles may be emulous of them</i></b>, namely the Jews, such that they imitate them in the worship of the one God: <i>you were at one time without Christ, alien to the way of life of Israel</i>, and later he adds, <i>but now you, who were once far off, have been drawn near in the blood of Christ</i> (Eph 2:12); <i>you have become imitators of the churches of God</i> (1 Thess 2:14), which are in Judea.
    <br />
    <br />
    Or it can be interpreted this way. The gentiles are emulous of the Jews, i.e., they are indignant against them on account of their unbelief: <i>I beheld the transgressors and I pined away, because they do not keep your words</i> (Ps 118:158).
    <br />
    <br />
    Third, it can be understood in this way. The Jews are emulous, i.e., imitate the gentiles when everywhere, and now some of them particularly, they are converted to the faith, imitating the faith of the gentiles; and in the end all Israel will be saved when the fullness of the gentiles have entered. Thus will be fulfilled what is said in Deuteronomy: <i>he will be the head and you will be the tail</i> (Deut 28:44).
    <br />
    <br />
    Fourth, it can be interpreted this way. The Jews are emulous of the gentiles, i.e., are disturbed out of envy towards them when they see their glory passing over to them: <i>I will provoke you by that which is not a people</i> (Deut 22:21).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph883"></span>
    <b>883.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>now if the offense of them</i></b>, he answers the question as interpreted in the second way and shows that the fall of the Jews is reparable. He does this in three ways:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, from its usefulness;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, from the Apostle’s intention, at <b><i>for I say to you</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, from the condition of that people, at <b><i>for if the firstfruit be holy</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph884"></span>
    <b>884.</b> In regard to the first he presents the following reason: a good is more powerful than an evil in producing usefulness, but the evil which befell the Jews produced something very useful for the gentiles, therefore, their good will produce greater usefulness for the world. What he is saying is this: it has been said that by their trespass the salvation of the gentiles was achieved. <b><i>Now if the offense of them</i></b>, i.e., the Jews’, <b><i>be the riches of the world</i></b>, i.e., for the gentiles, because the trespass of the Jews resulted in spiritual riches for the gentiles, about which it is said: <i>riches of salvation, wisdom and knowledge</i> (Isa 33:6), which refers to their guilt. <b><i>And the diminution of them</i></b>, by which they fell from the lofty glory they had, pertains to their punishment. <i>For we are diminished more than any nation and are brought low in all the earth this day for our sins</i> (Dan 3:37). They were, however, an occasion of <b><i>the riches of the gentiles</i></b>, as was said. Or <b><i>the diminution of them</i></b>, i.e., some of the least and most humble of the Jews, namely the apostles, enriched the nations spiritually, about which 1 Corinthians says: <i>God chose the weak things of the world, that he might confound the strong</i> (1 Cor 1:27). <b><i>How much more</i></b> will <b><i>the fullness of them</i></b>, i.e., their spiritual abundance or their multitude converted to God, result in riches for the gentiles? <i>My abode is in the full assembly of saints</i> (Sir 24:16).
    <br />
    <br />
    And so, if for the benefit of the whole world God permitted the Jews to do wrong and be diminished, much more will he repair their disaster for the benefit of the whole world.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph885"></span>
    <b>885.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>for I say to you, gentiles</i></b>, he shows the same things by revealing the purpose of his ministry, which he first states;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he assigns the reason, at <b><i>for if the loss</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph886"></span>
    <b>886.</b> In regard to the first it should be noted that whereas the previous parts of the epistle were directed to all the believers in Rome, whether from the Jews or from the gentiles, he is now directing his words to the converted gentiles.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph887"></span>
    <b>887.</b> He says, therefore: I have stated that their fullness will mean riches for the world. As testimony to this <b><i>I say to you, gentiles</i></b>, i.e., gentiles converted to the faith: <i>I said, ‘behold me’ to a nation that did not call upon my name</i> (Isa 65:1). This, I repeat, I say to you: <b><i>as long indeed as I am the apostle of the gentiles</i></b>, the special care of whom has fallen to me on account of the office entrusted to me: <i>they gave to me and to Barnabas the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the gentiles, and they unto the circumcision</i> (Gal 2:9); <i>for this was I appointed a preacher and apostle, a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth</i> (1 Tim 2:7); <b><i>I will honor my ministry</i></b>, not with things that pertain to worldly honor: but first by adorning it with good morals: <i>as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way in much patience</i>. (2 Cor 6:4). Second, by performing extra works to which he was not bound: <i>what is my reward then? That preaching the Gospel, I may deliver the Gospel without charge, that I abuse not my power in the Gospel</i> (1 Cor 9:18). Third, by increasing his solicitude for the salvation of all: <i>besides those things which are without: my daily instance, the solicitude for all the churches</i> (2 Cor 11:28).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph888"></span>
    <b>888.</b> Hence he adds: <b><i>if, by any means, I may provoke to emulation them who are my flesh</i></b>, i.e., the Jews, <b><i>who are my kinsmen according to the flesh</i></b> (Rom 9:3): <i>do not despise your own flesh</i> (Isa 58:7). And that they may emulate by good emulation, as is said in 1 Corinthians: <i>emulate the better gifts</i> (1 Cor 12:31). And in this way I <b><i>may save some of them</i></b>, namely, of the Jews: <i>not seeking my own advantage but that of many, that they may be saved</i> (1 Cor 10:33).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph889"></span>
    <b>889.</b> But this seems contrary to what he says in 2 Corinthians: <i>but we will not boast beyond limit, but will keep to the limits God apportioned us, to reach even to you</i> (2 Cor 10:13). But he had not accepted the limit of his service, which was to the gentiles. Therefore, he should not have concerned himself about the Jews.
    <br />
    <br />
    Some say that the Jews living in Judea did not pertain to his apostolate, but to that of Peter, James, and John (Gal 2:7). But the Jews living among the gentiles pertained to his apostolate and he worked for their salvation.
    <br />
    <br />
    But this seems contrary to his statement here. For if those Jews were the limit of his apostolate, he would not be magnifying his service.
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, it must be said that preaching to the gentiles was committed to him in such a way that he was bound to it by necessity, as he says: <i>woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel. For necessity is laid upon me</i> (1 Cor 9:16); but he was not forbidden to preach to the Jews, even though he was not bound to do so. Consequently, by working for their salvation he magnified his service. But he would not have done this, if he thought their fall irreparable.
    <br />
    <br />
    Hence the Apostle’s very zeal for the conversion of the Jews was the sign he adduced for stating that the fall of the Jews was reparable.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph890"></span>
    <b>890.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>for if</i></b>, he assigns the reason for his interest, namely, that the conversion of the Jews would contribute to the salvation of the gentiles. Hence he says, <b><i>for if the loss of them</i></b>, i.e., their unbelief and disobedience, as a slave is said to be lost when he flees from the care and obedience of his master: <i>my people have been a lost flock</i> (Jer 50:6). If, I say, the loss of the Jews occasions the <b><i>reconciliation of the world</i></b>, inasmuch as we have been reconciled to God through the death of Christ, <b><i>what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</i></b> I.e., that the Jews will be accepted again by God, as it says in Zechariah: <i>I took unto me two rods</i> (Zech 11:17). What, I say, will such an acceptance mean but that it will make the gentiles rise to life?
    <br />
    <br />
    For gentiles are the believers who will grow lukewarm: <i>because wickedness is multiplied, most men’s love will grow cold</i> (Matt 24:12), or will fall away entirely, being deceived by the Antichrist. These will be restored to their primitive fervor after the conversion of the Jews. And as the gentiles were reconciled after their enmity, the Jews having fallen away, so after the conversion of the Jews, the end of the world being then imminent, there will be a general resurrection, through which men will return from the dead to immortal life.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph891"></span>
    <b>891.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>for if the firstfruit</i></b>, he proves the same thing by considering the status of the Jewish race.
    <br />
    <br />
    This he does in two ways.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, on the part of the apostles, when he says: <b><i>if the firstfruit be holy, so is the lump also</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    That is called the representative portion which is taken from the whole lump of dough, as if for approval. The apostles chosen by God from the Jewish people are the representative sample taken from the whole lump. If, therefore, the apostles are holy, the consequence is that the Jewish people are holy. <i>You are a holy nation, God’s own people</i> (1 Pet 2:9).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph892"></span>
    <b>892.</b> Second, he proves the same thing on the part of the patriarchs, who are compared to the Jews as root to branches; hence it says in Isaiah: <i>there shall come forth a rod from the root of Jesse</i> (Isa 11:1). If, therefore, the patriarchs, who are the root, are holy, then the Jews, who grew from them as branches, are also holy. <i>And his root shall shoot forth as that of Libanus, and his branches shall spread</i> (Hos 14:6).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph893"></span>
    <b>893.</b> But this seems to conflict with what is said in Exodus: <i>if a man is righteous, he shall surely live</i> (Exod 18:9). Therefore, it does not follow that if the root is holy, so also the branches. There he also adds that <i>if the son seeing the sins of his father will have been afraid and will not have done the same, he shall not die, but will live life</i>; whence it seems not to follow that if the representative portion is holy, so is the whole lump.
    <br />
    <br />
    The answer is that the Apostle is not speaking here of actual holiness, for he does not mean to say that unbelieving Jews are holy; but of potential holiness. For if their ancestors and descendants are holy, nothing prevents them from being called back to holiness themselves.
    <br />
    <br />
    Or one might answer that those who imitate the patriarchs are a special type of branch, as it says in John: <i>if you were Abraham’s children, you would do what Abraham did</i> (John 8:39).
