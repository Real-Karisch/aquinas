    <b>894.</b> After showing that the fall of the Jews was useful and reparable, the Apostle now forbids the gentiles to boast against the Jews.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to this he does two things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he shows that the converted gentiles must not boast against the Jews;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he answers an objection from the gentiles, at <b><i>you will say then</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    In regard to the first he does two things:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he forbids the gentiles to boast against the Jews;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he gives the reason for this prohibition, at <b><i>but if you boast</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph895"></span>
    <b>895.</b> There seemed to be two things that might tempt the gentiles to boast against the Jews.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, the defection of the Jews. Hence he says: we have stated that if the root is holy, so too the branches. <b><i>And if some of the branches</i></b>, i.e., some of the Jews but not all, <b><i>be broken</i></b>, i.e., separated from the faith of their fathers who are compared as the root, <b><i>do not boast</i></b>: <i>the flame will dry up his shoots</i> (Job 15:30); <i>the branches not being perfect shall be broken</i> (Wis 4:5).
    <br />
    <br />
    The second ground for boasting was their own promotion. But the lower the state from which one has been promoted, the more he is inclined to vain boasting, as it says in Proverbs: <i>by three things the earth is disturbed, and the fourth it cannot bear: by a slave when he reigns</i> (Prov 30:21). Hence he reminds them of the low state from which they were raised, saying: <b><i>and you</i></b>, O gentile, when you were a gentile, <b><i>being a wild olive</i></b>, i.e., a tree bearing no fruit: <i>he shall be like tamaric in the desert</i> (Jer 17:6); <i>every tree that does not bear fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire</i> (Matt 3:10).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph896"></span>
    <b>896.</b> Then he describes their promotion.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, that they have been raised to the dignity of that race; hence, he says: <b><i>are ingrafted in them</i></b>, i.e., in their place: <i>he shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead</i> (Job 34:24).
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, that they have been made associates of the patriarchs, whom he had compared to the root; hence he says: <b><i>and are made partaker of the root</i></b>, i.e., united to the patriarchs and prophets: <i>many will come from the east and west, and sit at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven</i> (Matt 8:11).
    <br />
    <br />
    Third, that they share the glory of the apostles when he says: <b><i>and are made partaker of the fatness of the olive tree</i></b>. The Jewish race is called the olive tree on account of the rich spiritual fruit they bore: <i>the Lord called you once a plentiful olive tree, fruitful and beautiful</i> (Jer 11:16); <i>I am like a green olive tree in the house of God</i> (Ps 52:8). But just as the roots of this olive tree are the patriarchs and prophets, so its richness is the abundance of the Holy Spirit’s grace, which the apostles had more than all the others, as a Gloss says. Whence the olive tree was led to say: <i>can I leave my fatness . . . to come to be promoted among the trees?</i> (Judg 9:9); <i>let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness</i> (Ps 62:6). This, therefore, is the way the gentiles have been promoted to a partnership with that people, namely, with the patriarchs, apostles, and prophets: <i>you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets</i> (Eph 2:19).
    <br />
    <br />
    And although these may seem to be reasons for boasting, <b><i>do not boast against the branches</i></b>, i.e., against the Jews: <i>your boasting is not good</i> (1 Cor 5:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph897"></span>
    <b>897.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>but if you boast</i></b>, he gives the reason for his admonition, saying: <b><i>but if</i></b> in spite of this admonition <b><i>you boast</i></b> by insulting the Jews, who stand upright or have been cut off, you should consider as a check to your boasting that <b><i>you do not bear the root: but the root bears you</i></b>, i.e., Judea did not receive salvation from the gentiles, but just the reverse: <i>salvation is from the Jews</i> (John 4:22). Hence, Abraham was promised that all the nations of the earth would be blessed in him (Gen 22:18).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph898"></span>
    <b>898.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>you will say then</i></b>, he excludes an objection from the gentiles:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he presents the objection;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he excludes it from a consideration of divine justice, at <b><i>well</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, he urges them to diligently consider God’s judgments, at <b><i>see then the goodness</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph899"></span>
    <b>899.</b> First, therefore, he says: therefore, O gentile, who boasts against the Jews, you might say: <b><i>the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in</i></b>, i.e., God permitted the Jews to fall from faith, so that I might enter into faith.
    <br />
    <br />
    But no one accepts the loss of one thing save for something more precious and more desired, just as a physician allows a foot to remain sore in order to heal the eye. Thus, it would seem that the gentile nations are more valuable and acceptable to God than Judea. Hence it says in Malachi: <i>I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord of hosts, and I will not accept an offering from your hands. For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the nations</i> (Mal 1:10), and in Isaiah: <i>it is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob; I will give you as a light to the nations</i> (Isa 49:6).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph900"></span>
    <b>900.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>well</i></b>, he excludes the objection.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he assigns the reason why the Jews fell away and the gentiles were promoted, saying: <b><i>well</i></b>, i.e., it is good that God permitted branches to be broken off, so that you might be grafted in, but consider the cause of the breaking off of the branches. It is <b><i>because of unbelief</i></b>, i.e., because they refused to believe in Christ, <b><i>they were broken off</i></b>: <i>for you are among unbelievers and destroyers</i> (Ezek 2:6); <i>if I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?</i> (John 8:46). <b><i>But you</i></b>, O gentile, <b><i>stand by faith</i></b>, i.e., by believing in Christ, through whom you have obtained grace: <i>for in faith you stand</i> (2 Cor 1:23); <i>I preached to you the Gospel, in which you stand, by which you are saved</i> (1 Cor 15:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph901"></span>
    <b>901.</b> Second, he gives an admonition, saying: <b><i>be not highminded</i></b>, i.e., do not presume on yourself beyond yourself: <b><i>not minding high things, but consenting to the humble</i></b> (Rom 12:16); <i>Lord, my heart is not exalted: nor are my eyes lofty</i> (Ps 130:1); <b><i>but fear</i></b>, lest you too be broken off because of unbelief: <i>blessed is the man that is always fearful: but he that is hardened in mind, will fall into evil</i> (Prov 28:14); <i>the fear of the Lord drives out sin</i> (Sir 1:27).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph902"></span>
    <b>902.</b> The reason for this admonition is given when he says: <b><i>for if God has not spared the natural branches</i></b>, i.e., the Jews, who descended by natural origin from the patriarchs, but allowed them to be broken off, <b><i>fear lest perhaps also he does not spare you</i></b>, i.e., lest he permit you to be broken off because of unbelief: <i>the jealously and rage of the husband will not spare on the day of revenge</i> (Prov 6:34); <i>I will not spare and I will not pardon; nor will I have mercy, but to destroy them</i> (Jer 13:14).
    <br />
    <br />
    This, therefore, is the Apostle’s answer; that when someone sees that he has obtained grace and another has fallen, he should not boast against the fallen but rather fear for himself, because pride is the cause of falling headlong and fear is the cause of carefulness and being kept safe.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph903"></span>
    <b>903.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>see then the goodness and the severity of God</i></b>, he invites them to a close scrutiny of divine judgments:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he invites them to consider;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he instructs them as though unable to consider by themselves, at <b><i>for I would not have you ignorant</i></b> (Rom 11:25);
    <br />
    <br />
    third, as though he himself were not perfectly capable of this investigation, he exclaims in admiration of God’s wisdom, at <b><i>O the depth of the riches</i></b> (Rom 11:33).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph904"></span>
    <b>904.</b> In regard to the first he does three things: first, he shows what should be considered, saying: <b><i>see then</i></b>, i.e., give careful consideration to, <b><i>the goodness of God</i></b>, having mercy: <i>how good, O Israel, is God to the upright of heart</i> (Ps 72:1); <b><i>or do you despise the riches of his goodness?</i></b> (Rom 2:4). <b><i>And his severity</i></b> in punishing: <i>O Lord, you God of vengeance</i> (Ps 94:1); <i>the Lord is a jealous God and avenging</i> (Nah 1:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    For the first consideration begets hope; the second begets fear, so that despair and presumption are avoided.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph905"></span>
    <b>905.</b> Second, he indicates the ones affected by each of these two qualities, saying: <b><i>towards them indeed that are fallen</i></b>, i.e., the Jews, <b><i>the severity</i></b>: <i>the Lord has destroyed without mercy all the habitations of Jacob</i> (Lam 2:2); <b><i>but towards you</i></b>, the engrafted gentile, <b><i>the goodness</i></b>: <i>you have dealt kindly with your servant, O Lord</i> (Ps 119:65).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph906"></span>
    <b>906.</b> Third, he shows how the foregoing points should be considered, since the situation is not immutable but could change in the future.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph907"></span>
    <b>907.</b> First, he shows this with respect to the gentiles, saying: <b><i>towards you</i></b>, I say, <b><i>goodness, if you abide in goodness</i></b>: <i>remain in my love</i> (John 15:9). <b><i>Otherwise</i></b>, if you do not strive to persevere through fear and humility, <b><i>you also shall be cut off</i></b>: <i>every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down</i> (Matt 3:10).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph908"></span>
    <b>908.</b> Second, he shows the same with respect to the Jews. First, he states the fact: <b><i>and they also</i></b>, namely, the Jews, <b><i>if they do not abide still in unbelief, shall be grafted in</i></b>, i.e., restored to their former status: <i>you have prostituted yourself to many lovers. Nevertheless, return to me, says the Lord</i> (Jer 3:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph909"></span>
    <b>909.</b> Then he proves what he has said: first, from God’s power, saying: <b><i>for God is able to graft them in again</i></b>; therefore, their salvation is not to be despaired of: <i>behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save</i> (Isa 59:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph910"></span>
    <b>910.</b> Second, by arguing from the lesser, saying: <b><i>for if you</i></b>, O gentile, <b><i>were cut out of the wild olive tree</i></b>, i.e., from gentileness, which by nature was not fruit-bearing, not as God made nature, but because it was spoiled by sin: <i>they were a wicked generation, and their malice natural</i> (Wis 12:10); <i>we were by nature children of wrath</i> (Eph 2:3); <b><i>and were grafted into the good olive tree</i></b>, i.e., into the faith of the Jews, <b><i>contrary to nature</i></b>, i.e., against the common course of nature. For it is not the custom to graft the branch of a bad tree onto a good tree, but vice versa.
    <br />
    <br />
    But what God does is not against nature; it is natural in the fullest sense. For we call that natural which is caused by an agent to which the patient is naturally subject, even if it is not in keeping with the specific nature of the patient; for just as the ebb and flow of the sea is natural, because it is produced by the motion of the moon, to which the water is naturally subject, although it is not natural to the nature of water: so, too, since every creature is naturally subject to God, whatever God does in creatures is natural in the full sense, although it is not natural to the proper and particular nature of the thing in which it is done, say when a blind man has sight restored or a dead man is revived.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph911"></span>
    <b>911.</b> If, I say, this was contrary to nature, <b><i>how much more shall they that are the natural branches</i></b>, i.e., which by natural origin pertain to the Jewish nation, <b><i>be grafted into their own olive tree</i></b>, i.e., be brought back to the greatness of their nation: <i>he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and the hearts of children to their fathers</i> (Mal 4:6).
