    <b>859.</b> After showing that the fall of the Jews is deplorable, though not entirely excusable, the Apostle now shows that it is not universal.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he raises a question;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he answers it, at <b><i>God forbid</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, he draws a conclusion, at <b><i>what then</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph860"></span>
    <b>860.</b> First, therefore, he says: <b><i>I say then: has God</i></b> entirely <b><i>cast away his people?</i></b> i.e., the Jews, because he calls them unbelieving and contrary. Even the Psalmist asks: <i>O God, why dost you cast us forever?</i> (Ps 74:1); <i>the Lord has scorned his altar</i> (Lam 2:7).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph861"></span>
    <b>861.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>God forbid</i></b>, he answers the question and shows that God has not totally rejected the Jewish people. And this is what he says: <b><i>God forbid</i></b> that the Jewish people be rejected in their entirety. He proves this, first of all, with respect to himself, saying: <b><i>for I also</i></b>, living in the faith of Christ, <b><i>am an Israelite</i></b> by race: <i>are they Israelites? So am I</i> (2 Cor 11:22).
    <br />
    <br />
    And because there were among the people of Israel some proselytes not descended in the flesh from the patriarchs, he says that this is not so of him, adding: <b><i>of the seed of Abraham</i></b>: <i>are they descendants of Abraham? So am I</i> (2 Cor 11:23).
    <br />
    <br />
    Furthermore, among the Jewish people the tribes were distinguished according to the sons of Jacob, some of whom were sons of slaves and some of wives. Joseph and Benjamin were sons of Rachel, Jacob’s fondest wife. Hence he shows his eminence among the Jewish people, saying: <b><i>of the tribe of Benjamin</i></b>: <i>of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin</i> (Phil 3:5). Hence, some apply to Paul what is in Genesis: <i>Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, in the morning devouring the prey, and at evening dividing the spoil</i> (Gen 49:27).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph862"></span>
    <b>862.</b> Second, when he says: <b><i>God has not cast away</i></b>, he shows that his people has not been rejected by God in regard to many chosen ones.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he states his proposition;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he recalls a similar situation, saying <b><i>do you not know</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, he adapts it, at <b><i>even so then, at this present time</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph863"></span>
    <b>863.</b> First, therefore, he says: not only have I not been rejected, but <b><i>God has not cast away his people which he foreknew</i></b>, i.e., the predestined ones. <b><i>For whom he foreknew, he also predestined</i></b> (Rom 8:29). <i>For the Lord will not reject his people</i> (Ps 94:14). The Apostle applies this to the predestined.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph864"></span>
    <b>864.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>do you not know</i></b>, he recalls a similar situation which occurred during the time of Elijah, when all the people seemed to have turned from the worship of the one God.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he presents Elijah’s plea;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, the Lord’s reply, at <b><i>but what does the divine answer say</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph865"></span>
    <b>865.</b> First, therefore, he says: <b><i>do you not know what the Scripture says of Elias</i></b>, i.e., in 1 Kings (1 Kgs 19:10). Or, <b><i>of Elias</i></b>, i.e., in the book written about Elijah.
    <br />
    <br />
    For the entire book of Kings was written mainly to make known the sayings and deeds of the prophets. That is why it is counted among the prophetic books, as Jerome says. <b><i>How he</i></b>, namely Elijah himself, <b><i>calls on God against Israel</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph866"></span>
    <b>866.</b> The word of Samuel seems to be contrary to this when he says: <i>far from me be this sin against the Lord, that I should cease to pray for you</i> (1 Sam 12:23). Much less, then, should one intervene against the people.
    <br />
    <br />
    But it should be noted that prophets intervene against the people in three ways: in one way by conforming their wills to the divine will revealed to them, as it says in a psalm: <i>the just will rejoice when he sees the vengeance</i> (Ps 58:10). In another way by intervening against the kingdom of sin, in order that men’s sins but not men be destroyed. In a third way that the intervention or prayer be construed as a denunciation, as in Jeremiah: <i>let them that persecute me be confounded</i> (Jer 17:18), i.e., they will be confounded.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph867"></span>
    <b>867.</b> In this intervention Isaiah alleges two things against them.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, the impiety they committed against the worship of God. In one way, by persecuting his ministers, to which he refers when he says: <b><i>Lord, they have slain your prophets</i></b>: <i>has it not been told my Lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord?</i> (1 Kgs 18:13); <i>which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute?</i> (Acts 7:52). In another way, they committed impiety against God’s holy places, as it says: <i>they set the sanctuary on fire</i> (Ps 74:7). In regard to this he says: <b><i>they have dug down your altars</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph868"></span>
    <b>868.</b> Here it should be noted what the Lord commanded, saying: <i>you shall seek the place which the Lord your God will choose out of all your tribes to put his name and make his habitation there; thither you shall go, and thither you shall bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices</i> (Deut 12:5). However, before the temple was built, the people were allowed to build altars in various places for divine worship; but because this became illegal after the temple had been built, the pious king Hezekiah destroyed all such altars. And that is what it says in 2 Kings: <i>is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem: you shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?</i> (2 Kgs 18:22). Therefore, what Hezekiah did in a spirit of piety, Achab and Jezebel did in a spirit of impiety in their desire to root out the worship of God entirely.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph869"></span>
    <b>869.</b> Third, he alleges against them the impiety they intended to do, saying: <b><i>and I am left alone</i></b>, namely, to worship the one God, because the rest did not show very clearly that they were God’s worshippers. For it says of him: <i>and Elijah the prophet stood up, as a fire, and his word burnt like a torch</i> (Sir 48:1). <b><i>And they seek my life</i></b>, namely that they might carry him away. For Jezebel had sent word to Elijah, saying: <i>so may the gods do to me, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them</i> (1 Kgs 19:2), namely of the prophets of Baal whom Elijah had killed.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph870"></span>
    <b>870.</b> Then when he says <b><i>but what does</i></b>, he gives the divine reply, saying: <b><i>but what does the divine answer say to him</i></b>, i.e., to Elijah. It is this: <b><i>I have left me</i></b>, i.e., for my worship by not permitting them to fall into sin, <b><i>seven thousand men</i></b> (this definite number is put in place of the uncertain number, because seven and thousand are perfect numbers), <b><i>that have not bowed their knees to Baal</i></b>, i.e., who have not abandoned the worship of God: <i>all who call on my name, whom I created for my glory</i> (Isa 43:17).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph871"></span>
    <b>871.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>even so then</i></b>, he adapts all this to the present situation.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he sets out the adaptation, saying: <b><i>even so then, at this present time also</i></b>, in which a multitude of people seems to have gone astray, <b><i>there is a remnant saved according to the election of God’s grace</i></b>, i.e., according to the gratuitous choice of God: <i>you have not chosen me, but I have chosen you</i> (John 15:16).
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, he draws the conclusion from this: <b><i>and if by grace</i></b> they have been saved, <b><i>it is not now by works</i></b>: <i>he saved us, not because of deeds done by us in justice, but in virtue of his own mercy</i> (Titus 3:5).
    <br />
    <br />
    Third, that this conclusion follows from the premises is shown when he says: <b><i>otherwise</i></b>, i.e., if grace is in virtue of works, <b><i>grace is no more grace</i></b>, which is so called because it is freely given: <b><i>being justified freely by his grace</i></b> (Rom 3:24).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph872"></span>
    <b>872.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>what then</i></b>, he draws the conclusion he intended.
    <br />
    <br />
    And first he sets it out, saying <b><i>what then shall we say</i></b> follows from what has been said? This, namely, that <b><i>Israel</i></b>, as far as the greater part of its people was concerned, <b><i>has not obtained that which it sought</i></b>, namely, justice. This is the way one must interpret what was said above: <b><i>but Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not come unto the law of justice</i></b> (Rom 9:31). <i>You shall seek me, and shall not find me</i> (John 7:34).
    <br />
    <br />
    Nevertheless, <b><i>the election</i></b>, i.e., the elect of the Jews, <b><i>has obtained it</i></b>: <i>he chose us in him, that we should be holy</i> (Eph 1:4). But <b><i>the rest</i></b>, i.e., the remainder of the people, <b><i>have been blinded</i></b> because of their malice: <i>their own malice blinded them</i> (Wis 1:22).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph873"></span>
    <b>873.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>as it is written</i></b>, he clarifies the first part of the conclusion:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, on the authority of Isaiah;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, of David, at <b><i>and David says</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph874"></span>
    <b>874.</b> In regard to the first it should be noted that the Apostle bases himself on two passages from Isaiah. For it says in Isaiah: <i>the Lord has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep</i> (Isa 29:10). In regard to this he says: <b><i>God has given them the spirit of compunction</i></b>, which has to do with a perversity of emotion.
    <br />
    <br />
    For compunction implies a puncturing of the heart or sorrow. Hence there is good compunction by which one grieves over his own sins, as it says in a psalm: <i>you have made us drunk with the wine of compunction</i> (Ps 60:3). There is also evil compunction, i.e., the compunction of envy, by which one grieves over the goods of another.
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore God gave them this spirit of compunction, i.e., envy, not by instilling malice but by withdrawing grace, as was said above: <b><i>I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation</i></b> (Rom 10:19).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph875"></span>
    <b>875.</b> Likewise it says in Isaiah: <i>make the heart of this people fat, and their eyes heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears</i> (Isa 6:10). And in regard to this he designates their weakened power of knowing, when he adds <b><i>eyes that they should not see</i></b> the miracles which Christ performed in their presence, and <b><i>ears that they should not hear</i></b> fruitfully the teachings of Christ and the apostles: <i>you that see many things, will you not observe them? You that have ears open, will you not hear?</i> (Isa 42:20).
    <br />
    <br />
    To this the Apostle adds on his own: <b><i>until this present day</i></b>, because they will see and hear at the end of the world, when the hearts of the children will be converted to the hearts of their fathers, as it says in Malachi 4:5.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph876"></span>
    <b>876.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>and David says</i></b>, he presents the authority of David on the same point.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he touches on the things which occasioned the fall of the Jews, saying <b><i>let their table</i></b>, i.e., the malice with which sinners are nourished: <i>though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue</i> (Job 20:12). This table is before them, when they sin from malice aforethought and it becomes <b><i>a snare</i></b>, i.e., a temptation to sin: <i>he who comes out of the pit shall be caught in the snare</i>: (Isa 24:18), <b><i>and a trap</i></b>, when they succumb to the pleasure of the temptation: <i>they shall be trapped and taken</i> (Isa 8:15), <b><i>and a stumbling block</i></b>, when they fall from one sin into another: <i>much peace to those who love your law, and it is not a stumbling block to them</i> (Ps 119:165), <b><i>and a retribution unto them</i></b>, namely, when they will be punished for their sins. Or because the very fact that God permits them so to fall is itself a retribution for their sins: <i>render to the proud their deserts</i> (Ps 94:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    Or the <b><i>table</i></b> is the Sacred Scripture put before the Jews: <i>she has set forth her table</i> (Prov 9:2). It becomes <b><i>a snare</i></b>, when something ambiguous occurs; <b><i>a trap</i></b>, when it is not correctly understood; <b><i>a stumbling block</i></b>, when it falls into obstinate error; and <b><i>a retribution</i></b>, as explained above.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph877"></span>
    <b>877.</b> Second, he mentions the weakening of their power to understand when he says: <b><i>let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see</i></b>, which is said more as a prediction than as a desire: <i>having their understanding darkened</i> (Eph 4:18). And he mentions the effect when he says, <b><i>and their backs</i></b>, i.e., free choice, which carries something for good or for evil, <b><i>bow down always</i></b>, i.e., bend from eternal things to temporal things, from the path of justice to iniquity: <i>bow down, that we may pass over</i> (Isa 51:23).
