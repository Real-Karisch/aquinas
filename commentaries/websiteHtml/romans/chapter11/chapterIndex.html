  <a href="lecture1.html"><sup>11:1</sup> I say then: has God cast away his people? God forbid! For I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.<br><sup>11:2</sup> God has not cast away his people which he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elias, how he calls on God against Israel?<br><sup>11:3</sup> Lord, <i>they have slain your prophets, they have dug down your altars. And I am left alone: and they seek my life</i>.<br><sup>11:4</sup> But what does the divine answer say to him? <i>I have left</i> me <i>seven thousand men that have not bowed their knees to Baal</i>.<br><sup>11:5</sup> Even so then, at this present time also, there is a remnant saved according to the election of grace.<br><sup>11:6</sup> And if by grace, it is not now by works: otherwise grace is no more grace.<br><sup>11:7</sup> What then? That which Israel sought, he has not obtained: but the election has obtained it. And the rest have been blinded.<br><sup>11:8</sup> As it is written: <i>God has given them the spirit of insensibility; eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear, until this present day</i>.<br><sup>11:9</sup> And David says: <i>let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense unto them</i>.<br><sup>11:10</sup> <i>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see: and bow down their back always</i>.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture2.html"><sup>11:11</sup> I say then: have they so stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid! But by their offense salvation is come to the gentiles, that they may be emulous of them.<br><sup>11:12</sup> Now if the offense of them be the riches of the world and the diminution of them the riches of the gentiles, how much more the fullness of them?<br><sup>11:13</sup> For I say to you, gentiles: as long indeed as I am the apostle of the gentiles, I will honor my ministry,<br><sup>11:14</sup> If, by any means, I may provoke to emulation them who are my flesh and may save some of them.<br><sup>11:15</sup> For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?<br><sup>11:16</sup> For if the firstfruit be holy, so is the lump also: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture3.html"><sup>11:17</sup> And if some of the branches be broken and you, being a wild olive, are ingrafted in them and are made partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree:<br><sup>11:18</sup> Boast not against the branches. But if you boast, you do not bear the root: but the root bears you.<br><sup>11:19</sup> You will say then: the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.<br><sup>11:20</sup> Well: because of unbelief they were broken off. But you stand by faith. Be not highminded, but be afraid.<br><sup>11:21</sup> For if God has not spared the natural branches, fear lest perhaps also he does not spare you.<br><sup>11:22</sup> See then the goodness and the severity of God: towards them indeed that are fallen, the severity; but towards you, the goodness of God,<br>if you abide in goodness. Otherwise you also shall be cut off.<br><sup>11:23</sup> And they also, if they do not abide still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.<br><sup>11:24</sup> For if you were cut out of the wild olive tree, which is natural to you, and, contrary to nature, were grafted into the good olive tree, how much more shall they that are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture4.html"><sup>11:25</sup> For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery (lest you should be wise to you yourselves) that blindness in part has happened in Israel, until the fullness of the gentiles should come in.<br><sup>11:26</sup> And so all Israel should be saved, as it is written: <i>there shall come out of Zion, he who shall deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob</i>.<br><sup>11:27</sup> <i>And this is to them my covenant: when I shall take away their sins</i>.<br><sup>11:28</sup> As concerning the Gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are most dear for the sake of the fathers.<br><sup>11:29</sup> For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.<br><sup>11:30</sup> For as you also in times past did not believe God, but now have obtained mercy, through their unbelief:<br><sup>11:31</sup> So these also now have not believed, for your mercy, that they also may obtain mercy.<br><sup>11:32</sup> For God has concluded all in unbelief, that he may have mercy on all.</a>
  <br />
  <a href="lecture5.html"><sup>11:33</sup> O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his ways!<br><sup>11:34</sup> For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counsellor?<br><sup>11:35</sup> Or who has first given to him, and recompense shall be made him?<br><sup>11:36</sup> For from him, and through him, and in him, are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen.</a>
