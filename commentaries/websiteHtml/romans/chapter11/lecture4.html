    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph912"></span>
    <b>912.</b> After leading the gentiles to a knowledge of the divine judgments, in which God’s goodness and severity were manifested, the Apostle, acting as though they are still unable to consider these things, explains how they seem to him.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he presents the fact;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he proves it, at <b><i>as it is written</i></b>;
    <br />
    <br />
    third, he gives the reason, at <b><i>for as you also</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph913"></span>
    <b>913.</b> In regard to the first he does three things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he states his intention, saying: I have urged you to consider the kindness and severity of God, <b><i>for I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery</i></b>, for you cannot grasp all mysteries. Hence, this is a prerogative of the perfect to whom the Lord says: <i>to you it has been given to understand the mystery of God’s kingdom</i> (Luke 8:9); <i>I will not hide from you the mysteries of God</i> (Wis 6:24). But ignorance of this mystery would be very damaging to us: <i>but if any man know not, he shall not be known</i> (1 Cor 14:38).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph914"></span>
    <b>914.</b> Second, he discloses the reason for his intention: <b><i>lest you should be wise in your own conceits</i></b>, i.e., that you not presume on your own understanding to condemn others and prefer yourself to them: <b><i>be not wise in your own conceits</i></b> (Rom 12:16); <i>woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and shrewd in their own sight</i> (Isa 5:21).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph915"></span>
    <b>915.</b> Third, he states what he intended.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, with respect to the fall of particular Jews, when he says: <b><i>that blindness in part has happened in Israel</i></b>, not universally but upon a part: <i>blind the heart of this people</i> (Isa 6:10).
    <br />
    <br />
    Second, he predicts the end of this blindness, saying: <b><i>until the fullness of the gentiles should come in</i></b> to the faith, i.e., not only some gentile nations as were then converted; but either in all or the greater part the Church would be established: <i>the earth is the Lord’s and all its fullness</i> (Ps 24:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    The gentiles converted to the faith are said to come in, as though from the exterior and visible things they venerated into spiritual things and the divine will: <i>come into his presence with singing</i> (Ps 100:2).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph916"></span>
    <b>916.</b> It should be noted that the word <b><i>until</i></b> can signify the cause of the blindness of the Jews. For God permitted them to be blinded, in order that the full number of the gentiles come in.
    <br />
    <br />
    It can also designate the termination, i.e., that the blindness of the Jews will last up to the time when the full number of the gentiles will come to the faith. With this agrees his next statement, namely, <b><i>and then</i></b>, i.e., when the full number of the gentiles has come in, <b><i>all Israel should be saved</i></b>, not some, as now, but universally all: <i>I will save them by the Lord their God</i> (Hos 1:7); <i>he will again have compassion upon us</i> (Mic 7:19).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph917"></span>
    <b>917.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>as it is written</i></b>, he proves what he had said about the future salvation of the Jews:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he proves this with an authority;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, with a reason, at <b><i>as concerning the Gospel</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph918"></span>
    <b>918.</b> First, therefore, he says: I say that <b><i>all Israel should be saved, as it is written</i></b>, where our text says: <i>a redeemer will come from Zion and this will be my covenant with them that return to Jacob says the Lord</i> (Isa 59:20). But the Apostle uses the Septuagint and touches on three things.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, the coming of a Savior, when he says: <b><i>there shall come he that shall deliver</i></b>, namely, God in human flesh to save us, <b><i>out of Zion</i></b>, i.e., from the Jewish people who are signified by Zion, the citadel of Jerusalem, a city in Judea. Hence it says in Zechariah: <i>rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Lo, our king comes to you</i> (Zech 9:9), and in John: <i>salvation is from the Jews</i> (John 4:22).
    <br />
    <br />
    Or he says that he comes from Zion, not because he was born there, but because his doctrine went from there into the whole world, inasmuch as the apostles received the Holy Spirit in the cenacle in Zion: <i>out of Zion shall go forth the law</i> (Isa 2:3).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph919"></span>
    <b>919.</b> Second, he touches on salvation by Christ offered to the Jews, saying: <b><i>he who shall deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob</i></b>. This could refer to deliverance from punishment: <i>he will snatch my soul from death</i> (Ps 115:8). <b><i>He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob</i></b> could refer to deliverance from guilt: <i>O that deliverance for Israel would come from Zion</i> (Ps 53:6).
    <br />
    <br />
    Or both could refer to liberation from guilt, but he says <b><i>he who shall deliver</i></b>, because of the few, who now are converted with great difficulty and with, so to speak, a certain violence: <i>as if a shepherd should get out of the lion’s mouth two legs, or the tip of the ear, so shall the children of Israel be taken out</i> (Amos 3:12). But he says <b><i>he shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob</i></b> to show the ease with which the Jews will be converted at the end of the world: <i>who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression for the remnant of his inheritance?</i> (Mic 7:18).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph920"></span>
    <b>920.</b> Third, he shows the manner of salvation when he says: <b><i>and this is to them my covenant</i></b>, a new one from me, <b><i>when I shall take away their sins</i></b>. For the old covenant did not remove sins, because <i>it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins</i> (Heb 10:4). Therefore, because the Old Testament was imperfect, a New Testament is promised to them: <i>I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah</i> (Jer 31:31) and it will have the power to remit sin through the blood of Christ: <i>this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins</i> (Matt 26:28); <i>he will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea</i> (Mic 7:19).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph921"></span>
    <b>921.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>as concerning the Gospel</i></b>, he proves his statement with a reason:
    <br />
    <br />
    first, he presents the proof;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, he removes an objection, at <b><i>for the gifts and the calling</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph922"></span>
    <b>922.</b> First, therefore, he says that their sins will be taken away and that after they have sins, they are enemies of Christ. <b><i>As concerning the Gospel, indeed</i></b>, which they resist, <b><i>they are enemies for your sake</i></b>, i.e., it has turned out to your benefit. Hence, it says in Luke: <i>as for those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me</i> (Luke 19:27); and in John: <i>but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father</i> (John 15:24).
    <br />
    <br />
    Or <b><i>as concerning the Gospel</i></b> means their enmity has helped the Gospel, which has been spread everywhere by reason of such enmity: <i>in the word of truth of the Gospel, which has come to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and growing</i> (Col 1:5).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph923"></span>
    <b>923.</b> But <b><i>they are most dear</i></b> to God <b><i>for the sake of the forefathers</i></b>, and this <b><i>as touching the election</i></b>, because he chose their descendants on account of their forefathers’ grace: <i>the Lord loved your fathers and chose their descendants after them</i> (Deut 10:15).
    <br />
    <br />
    This does not mean that the merits established by the fathers were the cause of the eternal election of the descendants, but that God from all eternity chose the fathers and the sons in such a way that the children would obtain salvation on account of the fathers; not as though the merits of the fathers were sufficient for the salvation of the sons, but through an outpouring of divine grace and mercy, the sons would be saved on account of the promises made to the fathers.
    <br />
    <br />
    Or it can mean <b><i>as touching the election</i></b>, i.e., as regards those elected from that people, salvation was obtained. For if they are dear to God, it is reasonable that they be saved by God: <i>the eye has not seen, O God, besides you, what things you have prepared for them that wait for you</i> (Isa 64:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph924"></span>
    <b>924.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>for the gifts and the calling</i></b>, he excludes an objection.
    <br />
    <br />
    For someone might claim that even though the Jews were formerly beloved on account of their forefathers, nevertheless the hostility they exert against the Gospel prevents them from being saved in the future. But the Apostle asserts that this is false, saying: <b><i>for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance</i></b>. As if to say: that God gives something to certain ones or calls certain ones is <b><i>without repentance</i></b>, because God does not change his mind: <i>the triumpher in Israel will not spare, and will not be moved to repentance</i> (1 Sam 15:29); <i>the Lord has sworn and will not change his mind</i> (Ps 110:4).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph925"></span>
    <b>925.</b> However, this seems false, for the Lord says: <i>it repents me that I made man</i> (Gen 6:7) and <i>if that nation against which I have spoken shall repent of their evil, I also will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them</i> (Jer 18:8).
    <br />
    <br />
    The answer is that just as God is said to grow angry, not because the emotion of anger is in him but because he is related to the effect of punishments after the manner of an angry man, so he is said to repent, not because the change involved in repentance is in him but because he changes what he had done after the manner of one who repents.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph926"></span>
    <b>926.</b> Nevertheless, it does seem that God’s gifts are not without repentance, because they are frequently lost, as in Matthew: <i>take the talent from him and give it to him that has ten talents</i> (Matt 25:28). Furthermore, God’s call seems to be changed sometimes, since it is written: <i>many are called but few are chosen</i> (Matt 22:14).
    <br />
    <br />
    But it should be noted that <b><i>gift</i></b> is taken here for a promise made according to God’s foreknowledge or predestination, and <b><i>calling</i></b> is taken for election. Because both are so certain, whatever God promises is as good as given and whomever he elects is somehow already called. Such temporal gifts and callings are not voided by a change in God, as though he repented of them, but by a change in man who casts them off: <i>take heed lest anyone be wanting in the grace of God</i> (Heb 12:15).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph927"></span>
    <b>927.</b> This passage can also be taken to mean that God’s gifts which are bestowed in baptism, and the calling by which the baptized person is called, exist without the repentance of the baptized person. Furthermore, it was introduced to counteract any despair about the future salvation of the Jews, since they do not seem to repent of their sin.
    <br />
    <br />
    But against this interpretation are the words of Peter: <i>repent and be baptized every one of you</i> (Acts 2:38).
    <br />
    <br />
    This can be answered by recalling that repentance is of two kinds: interior and exterior. Interior repentance consists in the heart’s contrition by which one is sorry for past sins. Such repentance is required of the baptized, because, as Augustine says: <i>no one who is arbiter of his own will can begin the new life, unless he repents of the old life; otherwise, he would approach dissembling</i>.
    <br />
    <br />
    But exterior repentance consists in making satisfaction outwardly, and this is not required of the baptized person, because by baptismal grace man is freed not only of guilt but of all penalty, in virtue of the passion of Christ who satisfied for the sins of all: <b><i>all we who are baptized in Christ Jesus are baptized in his death</i></b> (Rom 6:3); <i>by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit which he poured out upon us richly</i> (Titus 3:5).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph928"></span>
    <b>928.</b> But since the keys of the Church and all the other sacraments work by the power of Christ’s passion, it seems that by the same reasoning all the other sacraments should liberate man from guilt and from all punishment.
    <br />
    <br />
    But the answer is that Christ’s passion works in baptism in the manner of a generation, which requires that a man die completely to his former life to receive a new life. And because the debt of punishment belongs to the oldness of the former life, it is taken away in baptism. But in the other sacraments Christ’s passion works in the manner of a cleansing, as in the sacrament of penance. But a cleansing does not require that right away every remnant of weakness be taken away. And the same argument applies to the other sacraments.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph929"></span>
    <b>929.</b> But since the confession of sins is relevant for exterior repentance, one could ask whether confession of sins is required at baptism. And it seems that it is, because Matthew says that men were baptized by John, <i>confessing their sins</i> (Matt 3:6).
    <br />
    <br />
    But the answer is that John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance, namely because by receiving that baptism they declared that they would undertake penance for their sins, and so it was fitting that they should confess so that penance could be meted out to them in accord with the nature of their sins. But Christ’s baptism is a baptism for the remission of all sins, such that the baptized person no longer owes any satisfaction for his past sins, and for this reason there is no need for vocal confession. The reason confession is necessary in the sacrament of penance is so that the priest can, by the power of the keys, fittingly loose or bind the penitent.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph930"></span>
    <b>930.</b> Then when he says, <b><i>for as you also</i></b>, he gives the reason for the future salvation of the Jews after their unbelief.
    <br />
    <br />
    First, he shows a similarity between the salvation of both people;
    <br />
    <br />
    second, the cause of this similarity, at <b><i>for God has concluded</i></b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph931"></span>
    <b>931.</b> First, therefore, he says: so I say that Israel will be saved, although they are now enemies. <b><i>For as you also</i></b>, gentiles, <b><i>in times past did not believe God</i></b>: <i>you were once without God in the world</i> (Eph 2:12); <b><i>but now have obtained mercy</i></b>: <b><i>the gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy</i></b> (Rom 15:9); <i>I will have mercy on him who was without mercy</i> (Hos 2:23). And this was <b><i>through their unbelief</i></b>, which was the occasion of your salvation, as was said above.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b><i>So these also</i></b>, i.e., the Jews, <b><i>now</i></b>, i.e., in the time of grace, <b><i>have not believed</i></b>, namely, in Christ: <i>why do you not believe in me?</i> (John 8:46). And this is what he adds: <b><i>for your mercy</i></b>, i.e., in Christ’s grace, by which you have obtained mercy: <i>you have saved us according to your mercy</i> (Titus 3:5). Or they <b><i>have not believed</i></b> so that they might enter into your mercy. Or they <b><i>have not believed</i></b>, which turned out to be the occasion of the mercy shown to you, <b><i>that they also</i></b> at some time <b><i>may obtain mercy</i></b>: <i>the Lord will have compassion on Jacob</i> (Isa 14:1).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="anchor" id="paragraph932"></span>
    <b>932.</b> Then, when he says <b><i>for God has concluded</i></b>, he assigns the reason for this similarity, namely that God has willed to have mercy on all. And this is what he adds, <b><i>for God has concluded</i></b>, i.e., permitted to be concluded, <b><i>all</i></b>, i.e., every race of men, both Jews and gentiles, <b><i>in unbelief</i></b>, as in a certain bond of error: <i>all were fettered with the bonds of darkness</i> (Wis 17:2). <b><i>That he may have mercy on all</i></b>, i.e., that he may have mercy on every race of men: <i>but you have mercy upon all</i> (Wis 17:24). This does not extend to the demons in accord with the error of Origen, nor even to all men individually, but to every race of men. For the distribution is made according to races of individuals and not according to individuals of races. But God wills all to be saved by his mercy, so that they might be humbled by this and ascribe their salvation not to themselves but to God: <i>destruction is your own, O Israel: your help is only in me</i> (Hos 13:9); <b><i>that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be made subject to God</i></b> (Rom 3:19).
